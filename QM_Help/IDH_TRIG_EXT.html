<h1>Triggers: user-defined</h1>

<p>Quick Macros can be extended with new 
  trigger types. This topic gives information for programmers about creating user-defined 
  triggers. These triggers can be implemented completely in user-defined functions, 
  or partially in dlls or COM components. They can be added to the Properties 
  dialog, so that other QM users can simply download, import and use the triggers 
  like QM intrinsic triggers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are various Windows API functions that allow receiving notifications 
  about various events. Information about these functions can be found in <a href="../Other/IDP_MSDN.html">MSDN 
  Library</a>. Other way to create a trigger - periodically check some condition, 
  say every 1 second, using <a href="../Flow/IDP_REP.html" class="blue">rep</a> 
  and <a href="../Commands/IDP_WAIT.html" class="blue">wait</a>. Also, on the 
  Internet you can find <a href="../_COM/IDH_COM.html">COM components</a> that 
  can be used to receive various system notifications in form of <a href="../_COM/IDP_COM_EVENTS.html">COM 
  events</a>. Many notifications are provided by WMI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The main trigger function should start when QM file is loaded and run continuously. 
  It, for example, can have &quot;QM file loaded&quot; trigger (&quot;Run synchronously&quot; 
  must be unchecked), or started from the trigger management function (read below) 
  using <span class="blue">mac</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your trigger engine is about to start a macro, it should call the <a href="../Commands/IDP_DIS.html" class="blue">dis</a> 
  function to ensure that the macro and user-defined triggers are enabled. Use, 
  for example, this code: <span class=cod><span class=fq>if</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=fq>dis</span><span class=p>(</span>macro<span class=p>)</span> <span class=fq>or</span> <span class=fq>dis</span><span class=o>&#38;</span><span class=n>16</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=fq>ret</span></span>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To implement some triggers, must be used dlls, because the function that receives 
  notifications is called in context of other processes. But most notifications 
  can be received using only QM user-defined functions. QM language has all power 
  to create any trigger that does not require to be implemented in a dll or driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Integrating with QM</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your trigger will be easier to use if you integrate it with QM. To integrate 
  your trigger engine with QM, create a user-defined function (&quot;trigger 
  management function&quot;), and assign it &quot;Trigger management&quot; trigger. 
  QM will call the function to communicate with your trigger engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, about the trigger string. The format of the trigger string that is 
  displayed in the Trigger field on the toolbar is:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<pre>^Trigger_type trigger data</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here <b>Trigger_type</b> is the name of the trigger management function, and 
  <b>trigger data</b> is some trigger-defined string. The trigger data is optional 
  and is used only by the trigger engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The trigger management function must begin with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>function</span><span class=o>#</span> unused1 unused2 action <span class=t>UDTRIGGER</span><span class=o>&#38;</span>p</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="parts">
<p>The first two parameters are always 0.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - numeric value that defines the purpose for which the function 
is called.</p>
<p><b>p</b> - variable of <span class="type">UDTRIGGER</span> type that is used 
to exchange various information. Its members that are used with different actions 
are described below.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> QM calls the trigger management function when:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When this trigger type is selected in the Properties dialog.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 1.</p>
<p><b>p.iid</b> - <a href="../Functions/IDP_QMITEM.html">QM item id</a>.</p>
<p><b>p.hwnd</b> - handle of the &quot;Trigger&quot; property page of the Properties 
  dialog.</p>
<p><b>p.tdata</b> - old trigger data string. It is empty (s.lpstr=0) if the macro 
  does not have a trigger of this type. It is &quot;&quot; if the trigger does 
  not have a trigger data.</p>
<p> The function should create and initialize trigger's property page, and return 
  its window handle. The property page must be modeless dialog, child window of 
  <b>p.hwnd</b>. Use <span class=cod><span class=fu>ShowDialog</span><span class=p>(</span>x x x p.hwnd <span class=n>1</span> <span class=d>WS_CHILD</span><span class=p>)</span></span>. 
  If the trigger engine does not provide a property page, the function must just 
  return 0. Then QM will provide default property page to enter trigger data string.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When the Properties dialog is being closed (OK) while this trigger type 
  is selected. Is called only if the trigger engine provides a property page.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 2.</p>
<p><b>p.iid</b> - QM item id.</p>
<p><b>p.hwnd</b> - handle of the property page that was returned in action 1.</p>
<p><b>p.tdata</b> - empty.</p>
<p>The function must collect data from controls in the property page, format new 
  trigger data string (if any) and store it into <b>p.tdata</b>. Should not apply 
  the changes at this moment. Must return 0 if trigger is set, 1 if trigger is 
  not set, or 2 to not close the Properties dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When new trigger string must be validated. Is called after a trigger is 
  added or changed.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 3.</p>
<p><b>p.iid</b> - QM item id.</p>
<p><b>p.hwnd</b> - 0.</p>
<p><b>p.tdata</b> - new trigger data string.</p>
<p>The function must validate the new trigger data string. It can modify the string 
  if needed. Should not apply the changes at this moment. Must return 1 if the 
  string<b> </b> is valid, or 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When all triggers of this type must be applied. Is called when file is opened, 
  a trigger is added/changed/deleted, macro(s) deleted, and in other cases.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 4.</p>
<p><b>p.iids</b> - array of ids of all macros that have a trigger of this trigger 
  type.</p>
<p><b>p.niids</b> - number of elements in the array.</p>
<p>The function must remove old triggers and apply triggers to the macros whose 
  ids are in the <b>p.iids</b> array. For example, if the trigger engine uses 
  internal trigger tables, it must [re]create the tables. To get trigger strings, 
  use <a href="../str/IDP_S_MACRO.html">str.getmacro</a> or <a href="../Functions/IDP_QMITEM.html" class="blue">qmitem</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. When QM needs to display icon of this trigger type.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 5.</p>
<p>The function should return icon handle or 0. The icon is destroyed by QM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. When the user requests help for this trigger type.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 6.</p>
<p>The function should provide help. For example, it can display a message box, 
  or open a web page. Should return 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7, 8. When QM or an item is enabled or disabled.</p>
<p><b>action</b> - 7 if enabled, 8 if disabled.</p>
<p><b>p.iid</b> - QM item id or 0.</p>
<p>This notification is rarely useful. The function can just return 0. Return 
  1 if trigger tables have to be recreated; then QM will call this function (later) 
  with action=4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only actions 3 and 4 must be implemented. For other actions, the function can 
  just return 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The function is always called in QM main thread. If it starts the trigger 
  engine, it must create new thread for the engine (use <span class="blue">mac</span>). 
  Never use QM thread for user-defined triggers, because it can make QM unstable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The function is not called when it itself is changed in some way (disabled, 
  enabled, deleted, trigger added, removed or changed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If the function is disabled, it is not called, and does not appear in the 
  Properties dialog. But triggers of that type are not automatically disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
