<h1>Triggers: accessible object</h1>

<p>Launches the macro when the specified <a href="../Functions/IDP_ACCESSIBLE.html">accessible 
  object</a> generates an event. To assign this trigger, use the <A href="IDH_PROPERTIES.html">Properties</a> 
  dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Accessible objects are various user interface objects in a window, such as 
  buttons, text fields, list items, links, menus. This trigger type also supports 
  objects that are not window parts: top-level windows, caret (text cursor), cursor 
  (mouse pointer), sound and alert. There are numerous events that can be used 
  to launch the macro. Examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an object is created or destroyed.</p>
<p>When an object receives focus.</p>
<p>When an object's state or location changes.</p>
<p>When any of an object's properties change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> To discover events and object properties, use accessible object event logging. 
  Right click the output pane and check Log -&gt; Acc. events in the menu. In 
  the logging options dialog you can specify certain filters, to exclude some 
  types of events and objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each event, in the output is displayed indexed string that has this format:</p>
<p>i. event, idObject, idChild</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ow: object window class, id and text</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pw: top-level parent window class and name</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ao: accessible object properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properties that cannot be retrieved are not displayed. For example, if the 
  object window is <a href="../Other/IDP_WINDOWSTYLES.html">top-level window</a>, 
  it does not have parent window, and pw line is not displayed. In the Properties 
  dialog, leave corresponding fields empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Properties dialog, select an event in the list at left, and enter other 
  properties in the right. All properties except idObject are optional, but should 
  be specified at least object window class (or/and id) and parent window class 
  (and name, if class isn't unique). Accessible object properties and child window 
  text are slower to retrieve, and therefore should be used only if really necessary. 
  Note that idChild is not child window id, but is used to identify the accessible 
  object. If it is some nonzero value, consider checking &quot;Any nonzero&quot;, 
  because often it is nonconstant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Class names must be full or with wildcard characters (QM 2.3.4). Other strings can be partial. If Use * is checked, must be full or with <a href="../Functions/IDP_MATCHW.html">wildcard 
  characters</a>. Empty fields are not evaluated. To match empty string, 
  use single * character in that field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are quite many fields in the Properties dialog. It is easy to make a 
  mistake when filling them. If the trigger does not work (macro does not run) 
  when expected, temporarily check Debug and click OK. Then try to reproduce the 
  conditions that should cause the macro to run. In the output pane will be displayed 
  the first property that doesnt match when an event of that type occurs and these 
  properties match: idObject, idChild, ow class and pw class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The macro can receive trigger information through the <span class="blue">function</span> 
  statement that is inserted with your confirmation when you close the Properties 
  dialog. <b>hwnd</b> is object window handle. If it is a child window, you can 
  use <span class=cod><span class=t>int</span> h<span class=o>=</span><span class=fd>GetAncestor</span><span class=p>(</span>hwnd <span class=n>2</span><span class=p>)</span></span> to get its top-level parent window handle. To get the accessible object, 
  you can use ObjectFromEvent function of <span class="type">Acc</span> class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before logging, save all your work in all programs, because some events of 
  some objects may crash the program to which the object belongs. When an exception 
  occurs while logging, QM tries to handle it so that the program would not crash, 
  but it is not always possible. Particularly, exceptions occur 
  when QM tries to get accessible object properties. This is another reason why 
  you should not use accessible object properties in triggers where the object 
  can be identified not using them. To make logging safe, check &quot;don't get 
  ao properties&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Events &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;hide&quot; are unreliable with 64-bit windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trigger type is based on Microsoft Active Accessibility and WinEvents. 
  You can read more in <a href="../Other/IDP_MSDN.html">MSDN library</a> (search 
  for WinEvents). To read about event types, search MSDN for &quot;Event Constants&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's make trigger &quot;any web page in Internet Explorer is opened and fully 
  loaded&quot;. Open Internet Explorer (IE). Then switch to QM, right click the 
  output pane and select Log -&gt; Acc. events in the popup menu. In the dialog, 
  click OK. Switch to IE and open a page, for example, Google page. Then switch 
  to QM and stop logging (click the same menu item). Try to find an event that 
could be used for this trigger. Probably the best event is this (or similar; may depend on Internet Explorer version):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.... CREATE, WINDOW, 0</p>
<p>ow: class=&quot;Internet Explorer_Server&quot;, id=0</p>
<p>pw: class=&quot;IEFrame&quot;, name=&quot;Google - Microsoft Internet Explorer&quot;</p>
<p>ao: role=PANE, state=0x100040, name=&quot;Google&quot;, value=&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Properties dialog, select Accessible object, CREATE. In the right, 
  enter object window class (Internet Explorer_Server) and top-level parent window 
  class (IEFrame). As parent window name, optionally enter Internet Explorer. 
  Click Next and select PANE in the Role combobox. Leave Name and Value fields 
  empty, unless you want to make the trigger specific to this page only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click OK. QM will ask whether to insert code to receive trigger properties. 
  Let's say, you need page URL. Then click Yes. It adds two lines of 
  code at the beginning of the macro. Uncomment the second line (delete space 
  at the beginning). The a variable can be used to access and manipulate the PANE 
  accessible object. Its Value property contains the URL of the page. Insert the 
  code to get the Value property. You can use the Accessible Object Actions dialog 
  to insert it.</p>
