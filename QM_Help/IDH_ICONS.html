<h1>Icons</h1>

<p>The Icons dialog can be used to find or create icons for <a href="IDH_MENUICONS.html">toolbars, 
  menus</a>, <a href="IDH_ITEMS.html">QM items</a> and shortcuts.</p>

<h2>Left side - icon browser</h2>
<p>Here you can find icons, assign them to menu items, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i>Browse</i> - open an icon file. You can select files and view their icons 
  without closing the Open dialog. The small button shows menu of recent files. 
  To add a file to the menu or move it to the top, select the file in the 'Open 
  icon file' dialog and press OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Actions</i> - shows menu of icon actions. Most actions use the current icon. 
  The icon is displayed in the dialog, and its file name and index is in the title 
  bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <i>Set icon...</i> - assign the icon to a menu/toolbar item, or to the current 
  QM item, or to items of the same type as the current QM item, etc. For menu/toolbar 
  items, inserts the icon file path into the editor text, in the line that contains 
  the text cursor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Reset</i> - assign default icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Edit</i> - open the icon in the icon editor at the right. If the icon is 
  from a library (dll, exe, etc) or is not compatible (read below), opens it as 
  new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Edit in external editor</i> - open the icon file in another program that 
  is specified in Options -&gt; Tools. If the icon is from a library, at first 
  saves it to an ico file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Save as ico file</i> - if the icon is from a library, saves it to an ico 
  file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Copy path</i> - store path of the icon to the clipboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Paste path</i> - open icon file whose path is in the clipboard as text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Set default save folder</i> - choose a folder where Save As dialogs will 
  start. It is not used by the Browse button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Refresh icons</i> - reload changed icons of QM items and common icons. To 
  improve performance, icons are cached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Imagelist Editor</i> - creates imagelists that can be used with various 
  controls in dialogs.</p>
<!--<p>[] Then you can assign t_imagelist to controls using messages, or use it with 
  ImageList_X functions for other purposes. All this is documented in the MSDN 
  Library. You can assign single imagelist to multiple controls, or use several 
  imagelists. Make sure that controls don't destroy it. The variable destroys 
  it automatically. The variable must exist while the imagelist is used by controls, 
  therefore it should not be local.</p>-->
<h2>Right side - icon editor</h2>

<p> Here you can create simple icons for menus, toolbars and QM items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you create or edit an icon, click &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As&quot;. 
  Then you can use the Actions menu to assign the icon to a menu item, etc. QM 
  does not automatically save icons or prompt to save when closing the editor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The editor saves icons to *.ico files that contain one small icon (16x16 pixels, 
  16 or 256 colors). Usually icon files contain two or more icons of various size 
  and color count. To prevent overwriting such icons, the editor opens them as 
  new.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tips</h4>



<p>Right click the grid to undo. Ctrl+left click to pick color.</p>

<p>Drag the preview icon to capture an icon or to move the image in the editor. 
  Drag with Ctrl to capture-add. While capturing, you can see top-left pixel's 
  <a href="../Other/IDP_COLOR.html">color</a>.</p>

<p>The eraser color will be transparent.</p>

<p>When drawing, you can keep the Color dialog open and use it as alternative 
  palette.</p>
<h2>How QM uses custom icons</h2>
<p>In QM 2.3.0.3 and later, you can set custom icons for QM items and item types. 
  Also changed the way QM uses icons in menus, dialogs, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In menus and toolbars: For items are used the same default icons that are displayed 
  in QM. Also now you can set default icon for submenus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="UDF">ShowDialog</span>, <span class="UDF">AddTrayIcon</span>, 
  <span class="UDF">MainWindow</span>: As default icon is used the icon of the function 
  or macro that started the thread. In <a href="IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a> - exe icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paths of icons of QM items are saved in the QM file together with items.  Paths of icons of QM item types are saved in the registry.</p>
