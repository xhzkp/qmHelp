<h1>QM keyboard shortcuts</h1>

<p>Most QM main window keyboard shortcuts 
  are given in menus and tooltips. Here are the others:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="tnormal">
  <tr> 
    <td>Alt+Right</td>
    <td>Set keyboard focus to the code editor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Alt+Left</td>
    <td>Set keyboard focus to the list of QM items.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Alt+Up</td>
    <td>Set keyboard focus to the 'Find help, functions, tools' field in the toolbar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alt+Down</td>
    <td>In some edit fields shows a popup list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enter</td>
    <td>In some controls - focus the editor, like Alt+Right. Try Ctrl+Enter if don't need it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you can use keys that are common in navigation: Applications (context 
  menu), Up, Down, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Default global hotkeys (Options -&gt; Hotkeys):</h4>

<table class="tnormal">
  <tr> 
    <td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q</td>
    <td>Show Quick Macros main window.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M</td>
    <td>Show My Macros window.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D</td>
    <td>Enable/disable triggers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Pause</td>
    <td>End macro. Modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win) are not allowed because they 
      would interfere with macro-pressed keys. If you press the key while a macro 
      is running, the macro stops and the key is blocked (not passed to the active 
      window). Otherwise the key is not blocked. The hotkey sent by <span class="blue">key</span> is ignored when using low-level keyboard hook (see Options -&gt; Triggers).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R</td>
    <td>Start or retry recording.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W</td>
    <td>Quickly record single command, where <i>window</i> argument 
      is window or control from mouse pointer. The hotkey works only when Quick 
      Macros window is not hidden.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
