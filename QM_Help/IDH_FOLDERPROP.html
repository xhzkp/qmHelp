<h1>Folder properties, file properties</h1>

<h2>Folder properties</h2>

<p>To show the Folder Properties dialog, right click that folder in the list of 
  macros and select menu item &quot;Folder properties&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <i>Description</i> - text that is shown in the QM file viewer when importing 
  or opening. Also, in tooltips (until first empty line).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <i>Scope of triggers </i>- one or several programs, with which work or not 
  work triggers (keyboard, mouse and window) of all items in the folder and subfolders. 
  Several program names must be separated with comma. Example: NOTEPAD,CALC .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <i>Read-only </i>- items in this folder and subfolders cannot be modified 
  (text, properties, etc), deleted, renamed, inserted new items, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i>Disabled items </i>- all items in the folder and subfolders are disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i>Private functions </i>- functions from the folder and subfolders are not 
  displayed in  <a href="IDH_TYPEINFO.html">type-info popup lists</a>, unless 
  you are editing an item that is in parent folder or its subfolders, or use Ctrl+Shift+. 
  . These functions still can be used everywhere. Also these functions and other items are hidden or gray in &quot;Running items&quot; pane and Threads dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Application </i>- <a onClick="doSection(e1)" class="expand">obsolete</a>.</p>
<div id="e1" class="expand">
  <p>This is obsolete and may be incompatible with some other QM features added later. Initially added to create separate scopes for variables, 
    functions and some declarations. Now instead can be used classes, thread variables, 
    sub-functions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Adds these features:</p>
  <p> 1. Functions that are in this folder can be called only from functions that 
    are in this folder.</p>
  <p> 2. The first (topmost) function always begins execution. It is like an application's 
    main function.</p>
  <p> 3. Local variables declared in the main function can be used in other functions.</p>
  <p>4. Type libraries and reference files declared in the main function can be used in other functions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Note: Functions that are compiled at run time don't have these features. 
    For example if a function is called using <span class="blue">call</span> with 
    function's name as string.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Note: Don't call the main function recursively, because then its local variables 
    are different every time, because of variable <a href="../Language/IDP_SCOPE.html">scope 
      rules</a> (local variables have higher priority). For example, it happens 
    if the main function is a dialog procedure that also shows the dialog.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>QM 2.4.1: Fixed bug: in class member functions the 3 feature did not work.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>File properties</h2>

<p>All properties are same as folder properties, but applied are only &quot;Description&quot;, 
  &quot;Scope&quot;, &quot;Read-only&quot; and &quot;Disabled items&quot;. Other 
  properties are applied to imported folder when this file is imported into another 
  file.</p>
