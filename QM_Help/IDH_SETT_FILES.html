<h1>Options: Files</h1>

<p> <i>Auto backup</i> - create backup copies of currently used <a href="IDH_QML.html">QM files</a> in 
  the backup folder.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Default folder is My Documents\My QM\Backup.</li>
  <li>QM 2.4.0. Backups shared files too.</li>
  <li>QM 2.4.0. If you use some other software to backup QM files, note that currently open .qml files usually don't contain new changes. QM at first writes new changes to temporary .qml-wal files in the same folder. Let the backup software copy the files too. See also <a href="../User/IDP_QMFILE.html">_qmfile.FullSave</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Older files</i> - keep older backup files of specified age or less.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, if it is <tt>15m 1h 4h 1d</tt>, there will be maximum 5 backup files for a QM file. The older four files are maximum 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours and 1 days older (sometimes more older). Other auto-created backup files are auto-deleted.</li>
  <li>QM 2.3.5. In the older files list, you can append m, h or d to specify minutes, hours or days. If not specified, h assumed. In previous QM versions the numbers are always hours. Also there are more changes in QM 2.3.5. Different backup algorithm and file names.</li>
  <li>When you manually backup with the 'Backup now' button, the backup files have different names and are not auto-deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>My QM folder</i> - folder where QM and QM extensions will store various 
  files. This folder also contains the default main QM file. In macros, 
  where file path is used, this folder can be specified as $my qm$ (e.g., &quot;$my 
  qm$\my file.txt&quot;). Default path is $personal$\My QM (My QM folder in My 
  Documents). If there are multiple user accounts, each user has its own My Documents 
  folder.</p>
