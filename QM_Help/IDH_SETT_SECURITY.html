<h1>Options: Security</h1>

<p> <i>Encrypt macro</i> - encrypt or decrypt current item's text. Decrypting 
  requires the same password that was used when encrypting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If &quot;All containing text&quot; is checked, instead encrypts or decrypts 
    all items that contain the text. The text in items must be a full comments line, 
    ie a line that begins with a space or semicolon. Don't include the space/semicolon. 
    When decrypting, decrypts only items that are encrypted using the same password.</li>
  <li> Note 1: If you encrypt a macro that contains a <a href="../User/IDH_DIALOG_EDITOR.html">dialog</a> 
    definition, the dialog will not work, unless the dialog definition is assigned to a variable 
    which is passed to <span class="UDF">ShowDialog</span>.</li>
  <li>Note 2: When you click function name in code editor and press <a href="../Other/IDP_F1.html">F1</a>, you can see its parameters and help section (comments above code), even if the function is encrypted.</li>
  <li>Note 3: By default, QM creates backup files. They may contain unencrypted (older) versions 
    of your encrypted macros. The bad is that somebody can see the macros if you 
    don't delete the files. The good is that sometimes there you can find unencrypted 
    versions of your encrypted macros in case you have lost password. Usually QM 
    eventually deletes the files. Look in <a href="IDH_SETT_FILES.html">Options -&gt; Files</a>.</li>
</ul>
