<h1>Filter functions</h1>

<p>Warning: Incorrectly used filter functions can decrease system performance 
  and stability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Filter functions usually are used to narrow trigger scope. A filter function 
  is called when QM is about to start the macro to which the filter function is 
  assigned. Depending on filter function's return value, QM starts macro, or not, 
  or starts other macro. You can make the macro specific to a certain window, 
  window part, control, mouse pointer position, time, whatever. Filter functions are especially useful with triggers that &quot;eat&quot; trigger event (&quot;Eat&quot; 
  is checked in Properties).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A macro that has a trigger (key, mouse, window or autotext) can have a filter function. 
  To assign a filter function, use the Filter Function dialog, which appears when 
  you click the FF button in the Properties dialog. To use an existing filter 
  function, click &quot;Use&quot; and select one from the drop-down list. To create 
  new, click &quot;New&quot; (or click &quot;Copy&quot; and select an existing 
  filter function) and optionally type the name for the new filter function. Alternatively, 
  you can specify a filter function directly in the <A href="../Other/IDP_TRIGGER_CODING.html">Trigger</a> 
  field on the toolbar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A filter function is an usual user-defined function. You must write code for 
  it. It must begin with:</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=c> /
</span><span class=fq>function</span><span class=o>#</span> iid <span class=t>FILTER</span><span class=o>&#38;</span>f</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="parts">
<p> <b>iid</b> - <A href="../Functions/IDP_QMITEM.html">identifier</a> of the 
macro that is about to run (a macro  to which this 
filter function is assigned).</p>

<p> <b>f</b> - variable of type FILTER:</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>FILTER</span> hwnd hwnd2 x y hit <span class=o>!</span>itype <span class=o>!</span>ttype <span class=o>!</span>tkey <span class=o>!</span>tmod <span class=o>!</span>tkey2 []<span class=o>!</span>tmon []<span class=o>!</span>tht</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<div class="parts">
<p> <b>hwnd</b> - <A href="../Other/IDP_WINDOWEXPRESSION.html">handle</a> of 
<A href="../Other/IDP_WINDOWSTYLES.html">top-level</a> window.</p>
<ul>
  <li> For window triggers, 
    it is the trigger-window.</li>
  <li> For mouse click triggers - the clicked window.</li>
  <li> For other triggers - the active window.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>hwnd2 -</b> handle of child window or top-level window.</p>
<ul>
  <li> For key triggers, 
    it is the focused window (can be 0).</li>
  <li> For mouse triggers -  window 
    from mouse.</li>
  <li>For other triggers - 0.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>x</b>, <b>y -</b> mouse coordinates. Used only with mouse triggers.</p>

<p> <b>hit -</b> hit-test code of mouse trigger. Hit-test codes documented in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amicrosoft.com WM_NCHITTEST" target="_blank">WM_NCHITTEST</a> page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Other members provide some info about the macro. The same as in  
  <a href="https://quickmacros.com/help/QM_Help/..%5CFunctions%5CIDP_QMITEM.html">QMITEM</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return values for key, mouse and window triggers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="tnormal">
  <tr> 
    <th> Return value</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> <b>iid</b></td>
    <td>run the macro. Other macros that have  same trigger will not run.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>id or name of some other macro</td>
    <td>run other macro. For example, the filter function can select 
      a macro from a list of macros that should run from one main trigger depending 
      on other conditions (active window, mouse pointer position, etc).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>0</td>
    <td>don't run. Other macros that have  same 
      trigger also will not run.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>don't run, but eat the trigger event (if &quot;Eat&quot; is checked in the 
      Properties dialog). Usually -1 is used when the filter function itself 
      starts other macro (<A href="../Commands/IDP_MAC.html" class="blue">mac</a>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>-2</td>
    <td>don't run. Other macros that have same trigger possibly will run.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return values for  <a href="IDH_TSM.html">autotext</a> triggers:</p>
<table class="tnormal">
  <tr>
    <th> Return value</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>iid</b></td>
    <td>run the autotext list item. Other autotext lists that have  same trigger will not run.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 or -1</td>
    <td>don't run. Other autotext lists that have same trigger also will not run.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-2</td>
    <td>don't run. Other autotext lists that have same trigger possibly will run.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Possible various variants of usage of filter functions. Often a filter function 
  is specific to a single macro, but it also can be assigned to several macros 
  that have different triggers. If several macros must have the same trigger, 
  but run e.g. in different windows, assign the trigger and filter function to 
  one of them (or to the filter function itself); the filter function evaluates 
  conditions and depending on results allows starting different macros.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <b>iid</b> and <b>f</b> variables the function receives  information about the trigger. 
  To evaluate it, you can use functions <a href="../Flow/IDP_SEL.html" class="blue">sel</a>, 
  <A href="../Functions/IDP_WIN.html" class="blue">wintest</a>, <A href="../str/IDP_S_WINDOW.html" class="blue">getwintext, getwinclass</a>, 
  <span class="UDF">GetWinId</span>, <span class="UDF">GetWinStyle</span>, <span class="UDF">GetWinXY</span>, 
  <A href="../Functions/IDP_CHILD.html" class="blue"> child, childtest</a>, 
  <A href="../Functions/IDP_ID.html" class="blue">id</a>, <A href="../Functions/IDP_QMITEM.html" class="blue">qmitem</a>, 
  <span class="blue"> </span> <A href="../str/IDP_S_MACRO.html" class="blue">getmacro</a> 
  and other. Information that the function receives in  <b>f</b> 
  has different meaning for different trigger types (keyboard, mouse, etc). If a filter 
 function is created for one trigger type,  often it cannot be used with other 
 trigger types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While filter function runs, other application waits and cannot process user 
  input. Therefore filter functions must be as fast as possible. They must only 
  evaluate conditions, also can start other macros (<span class="blue">mac</span>), 
  but itself MUST NOT CONTAIN MACRO COMMANDS (such as mouse, window, wait, dialogs, 
  etc). Max allowed time is
  1 second. You can use <a href="../Functions/IDP_PERF.html" class="blue">perf</a> 
  to measure the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Filter function runs while the target application is processing some input 
  event. For this reason, some code that communicates with that window (e.g., 
  <span class="blue">acc</span>(mouse)) in some cases may not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> All filter functions of key, mouse and window triggers run in one special <A href="../Other/IDP_THREADS.html">thread</a>. All filter functions of text triggers run in QM main thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a filter function is disabled, macros to which it is assigned run like without a filter function.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several filter function templates are available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you edit a filter function, to apply the changes click  Save or Compile 
  button.</p>
