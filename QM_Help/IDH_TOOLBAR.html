<p>Toolbars are used to launch macros, files, and to execute any other commands. 
  Toolbar syntax is the same as of <A href="IDH_POPUP.html">pop-up menu</a>, except 
  that toolbars cannot have submenus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A toolbar can be free or attached to a window. If a toolbar is attached to 
  a window, that window becomes owner of the toolbar. The toolbar always is on 
  top of that window. It is hidden when the window is minimized or hidden. It 
  is destroyed when the window is destroyed. It follows the window (optionally) 
  when the window is moved or resized. A toolbar can have multiple instances attached 
  to multiple windows. A window can have several different attached toolbars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A toolbar can be attached to a window using two ways:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Assign a <a href="IDH_TRIG_WINDOW.html">window trigger</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Launch the toolbar using <A href="../Commands/IDP_MAC.html" class="blue">mac</a> with window handle as command. Example: <span class=cod><span class=fq>mac</span> <span class=s>&#34;Toolbar9&#34;</span> <span class=c2></span><span class=fq>win</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s>&#34;Calc&#34;</span><span class=p>)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If toolbar is launched using some other way, it isn't attached to a window. 
  Such toolbar is always on top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macro launched from a toolbar receives toolbar window handle in the _command 
  variable. Use <span class="blue">val</span>(_command) to get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> When you use <A href="../Commands/IDP_MAC.html" class="blue">mac</a>, it returns 
  toolbar window handle (even if the toolbar was already running).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tips</h4>



<p>Move toolbar: drag with the mouse right button.</p>

<p>Move or delete a button: Shift+drag.</p>

<p>Add a button to run macro, file or open Internet link: drag and drop. Ctrl 
  can be used for shortcuts.</p>
<p> If you drag and drop a file onto a program icon, you can choose to open the 
  file in that program.</p>
<p>Right click toolbar to view context menu.</p>
<p>Don't show text of some buttons: insert tab at the beginning of line. You still 
  will see tooltips.</p>
