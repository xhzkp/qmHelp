<h1>Quick Macros extensions</h1>

<p>If you have some programming experience, you can do with QM most of things that 
  you can do with C++ or other programming languages. You can create and call functions, use dll and COM functions (Windows API, C run-time 
  library and other), create dialogs, create new trigger types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can share useful functions and macros (import, export), for example in Quick Macros <A href="http://www.quickmacros.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">forum</a>. 
  If you share your macros/functions, remember that they may not work on older 
  QM versions. You should provide version info, e.g. &quot;Tested with QM 2.3.5, 
   Windows 7.&quot;. Macros compiled to <a href="IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe 
  files</a> don't require QM and therefore will always work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many QM features are implemented as QM extensions. They are in System.qml <a href="IDH_QML.html">file</a> (the System folder in the list of macros). Many functions, declarations, dialog editor, code toolbar dialogs etc are there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many other functions are in Quick Macros <a href="http://www.quickmacros.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3368" target="_blank">forum</a>.  If you cannot find a function you need, you can request it in the 
forum<A href="http://www.quickmacros.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank"></a>.</p>
