<h1>Triggers: event log</h1>

<p>Launches the macro when an event is added to the Windows Event Log. To assign 
  this trigger, use the Properties dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows and applications record important events to the Windows Event Log. 
  You can see these events in the Event Viewer. For example, Windows logs when 
  an application is shut down due to an error, when an Internet connection is connected/disconnected, 
  when services are started/stopped/paused, various other errors and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several logs - System, Application, Security, and possibly more. 
  Event source typically is the application or service that logs the event. Event 
  id is an unique number (within that source) that identifies the event. Message 
  is a text information. Message typically is composed of constant text that is 
  associated with that event id, and inserted strings that are specific to a particular 
  event. If &quot;Retrieve full message&quot; is unchecked, is retrieved only 
  these inserted strings, separated by spaces. This is much faster, because to 
  retrieve whole message QM have to load the dll that contains the text. Since 
  you can specify event id, you don't have to retrieve whole message to identify 
  the event. In the Message field can be used wildcard characters * and ?.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The macro can receive trigger information through the <a href="../Language/IDP_FUNCTION.html" class="blue">function</a> 
  statement that is inserted with your confirmation when you close the Properties 
  dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Event log triggers don't work on user accounts with limited rights because 
  access to event logs is denied.</p>
