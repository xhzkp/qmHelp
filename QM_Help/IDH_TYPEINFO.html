<h1>Help and type info</h1>

<p>To enter some often used macro commands, you can use dialogs from the code 
  toolbar. If the toolbar is unavailable, click the &quot;Check extensions&quot; 
  button in Options and follow instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../image/qmtoolbar.gif" border=0></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> However, Quick Macros does not provide dialogs for all commands and functions. 
  You will have to type them directly in the editor. You can find all intrinsic 
  commands and functions through the <a href="../Reference/IDH_REFERENCE.html">reference</a> 
  topic. There are several features that can help in finding  commands and 
  getting help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you type dot (<tt>.</tt>) somewhere in text (for 
  example, at the beginning of a line), appears list of functions and other identifiers 
  that you can use. Various type kinds (functions, types, constants, variables, 
  etc) have different <a href="../Language/IDP_DECLARATION.html">icons</a>. To 
  insert an identifier, double click it. Or begin to type, and press Tab or Enter to complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the top of the list are  <a href="../Language/IDP_CATEGORIES.html">categories</a> 
  - collections of related functions. Type <span class=cod>.</span> after a category name to view 
  the functions. At the bottom of the list are 
   various libraries. Type <span class=cod>.</span> after a library name to view its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Press:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ctrl+, to view only types.</li>
  <li> Ctrl+. for 
    global functions.</li>
  <li> Ctrl+/ for constants and  variables.</li>
  <li> Ctrl+; for local/thread variables, also member variables and functions of current class.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also there are many 
  other functions (member functions) that are displayed when you type <span class=cod>.</span> after a variable of a certain type, for example str,   Acc, Database, ARRAY, BSTR, a COM interface. 
  To use such functions, declare a variable of that type, and call functions with 
  that variable. Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=t>Ftp</span> f
f.Connect<span class=p>(</span><span class=s>&#34;ftp.myserver.com&#34;</span> <span class=s>&#34;user&#34;</span> <span class=s>&#34;passw&#34;</span><span class=p>)</span>
f.DirSet<span class=p>(</span><span class=s>&#34;public_html&#34;</span><span class=p>)</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the lists, names of hidden and restricted members are gray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to hide a user-defined function in the list, 
  place it in a <a href="IDH_FOLDERPROP.html">private folder</a>. The list also 
  does not show anything that begins with __ (two underscores). To show hidden items, 
  press Ctrl+Shift+. or use menu Edit -&gt; Members -&gt; Show Hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show the list when you already partially typed an identifier, choose the 
  Completion command (Ctrl+Space). In most cases it shows only identifiers that 
  begin with the same letter. Ctrl+. and other commands also can be used for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the text insertion point is on an identifier (function, 
  type, etc, except variables), QM status bar shows some info for it. You can Ctrl+click 
  to view it in QM output.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Optional parameters are [enclosed].</li>
  <li> | means OR.</li>
  <li>Some parameter names are preceded by type name or character, like in <a href="../Language/IDP_FUNCTION.html">function declaration</a>. For example, string parameters are preceded by $ 
  or ~. If it is ~, you can pass a string or a number. If type not specified, it is int (integer number).</li>
  <li>If a parameter supports values of  several types, shows ` or the mostly used type.</li>
  <li>Short description and other additional info is displayed as comments (green). Read <a href="../Other/IDP_F1.html">here</a> how to add function info to the status bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The status bar info for intrinsic and user-defined functions 
  is always available. For other user-defined identifiers, it is available only 
  if the identifier is already <a href="../Language/IDP_DECLARATION.html">declared</a>. That is, if the macro or function with the declaration is already <a href="IDH_DEBUG.html">compiled</a>, 
  or the identifier is from a <a href="../_COM/IDP_TYPELIB.html">type library</a> 
  or <a href="../Language/IDP_REF.html">reference file</a>. QM also automatically 
  declares identifiers from type libraries and reference files when typing <span class=syntax><span class="lib">typelib</span>.identifier</span>. 
  QM also may look in reference files to show  info in QM status bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show help for a function or other identifier, type or click it and press 
  <a href="../Other/IDP_F1.html">F1</a>.</p>
