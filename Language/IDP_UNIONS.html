<h1>Type member alignment; unions</h1>

<h2>Structures</h2>
<p>A <i>structure</i> is a type that has member variables. Most of these types are <a href="IDP_TYPE.html">user-defined 
  types</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only these types don't have member variables:</p>
<p>byte - 1 byte.</p>
<p>word - 2 bytes.</p>
<p>int, lpstr, pointer, interface pointer - 4 bytes.</p>
<p>long, double - 8 bytes.</p>
<h2>Default alignment</h2>
<p> Structure members are placed in memory in the order they are defined. In the following 
  example, offset of <b>a</b> is 0, offset of <b>b</b> is 4 (because size of <b>a</b> 
  is 4), and size of structure is 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T1</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>a <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>b
<span class=t>T1</span> t
<span class=fq>out</span> <span class=s>&#34;%i %i   %i&#34;</span> <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.a<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.b<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=fq>sizeof</span><span class=p>(</span>t<span class=p>)</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that all members are not structures, these rules are applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A member is aligned so that its offset is divisible by its size.</li>
  <li> The size of the structure   is divisible by the size of its largest member.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the above reason, in some cases there may be some padding (1-7 unused bytes) between members and at the end. In the 
  following example, offset of <b>a</b> is 0, offset of <b>b</b> is 4 (3-byte padding after <b>a</b>), and size of structure is 12 (2-byte padding at the end).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T2</span> <span class=t>byte</span><span class=p>'</span>a <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>b <span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>c
<span class=t>T2</span> t
<span class=fq>out</span> <span class=s>&#34;%i %i %i   %i&#34;</span> <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.a<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.b<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.c<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=fq>sizeof</span><span class=p>(</span>t<span class=p>)</span></pre>
<h2>Nonstandard  alignment</h2>
<p>Some types use nonstandard member alignment.  In C/C++ languages, to set it is used #pragma pack. It can set alignment  1, 2, 4 or 8 (default). Structure members are aligned so that their offsets are divisible by their sizes or by the alignment value, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM 2.3.2. To set alignment, add [pack1], [pack2], [pack4] or [pack8] (default) at the end of type definition. Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T3</span> <span class=t>byte</span><span class=p>'</span>a <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>b <span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>c [pack1]
<span class=t>T3</span> t
<span class=fq>out</span> <span class=s>&#34;%i %i %i   %i&#34;</span> <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.a<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.b<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=o>&#38;</span>t.c<span class=o>-&#38;</span>t <span class=fq>sizeof</span><span class=p>(</span>t<span class=p>)</span></pre>

<h2>Explicit alignment; unions</h2>
<p>You can explicitly specify offsets of some members. It allows you to define 
  unions (structures with overlapped members of different types) and structures 
  with nonstandard member alignment. The member declaration must be preceded by 
  the offset (integer number) in square brackets. Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>LHWORD</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>i [<span class=n>0</span>]<span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>lo [<span class=n>2</span>]<span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>hi
<span class=t>LHWORD</span> lh.i<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>0x00050007</span>
<span class=fq>out</span> <span class=s>&#34;LOWORD is %i, HIWORD is %i&#34;</span> lh.lo lh.hi
<span class=c> Output: LOWORD is 7, HIWORD is 5
</span></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> If offset begins with +, it is interpreted as offset from offset of previous 
  member. Empty brackets means same offset as of previous member. Example:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>LHWORD</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>i []<span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>lo [<span class=o>+</span><span class=n>2</span>]<span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>hi</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> If offsets of all members are explicitly set, the size of the type also is 
  explicitly set. In the following example it is 6 (normally it would be 8, because 
  <b>i</b> would be at 4-byte offset):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>TYPE</span> [<span class=n>0</span>]<span class=t>word</span><span class=p>'</span>w [<span class=n>2</span>]<span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>i</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM 2.2.0. Implicit and explicit constructor/destructor/copy functions are not 
  called for union members (except of the VARIANT type). A <a href="IDP_DIR_OPT.html">warning</a> 
  is shown. QM cannot know which union member is valid 
  at the time. Clearing wrong member may be catastrophic. These members should 
  be cleared explicitly. For example, if an union member is an interface pointer, 
  and you know it is valid at the time, call its hidden function Release to clear 
  it. For BSTR, call SysFreeString. For ARRAY - SafeArrayDestroy. Also, there 
  are special functions for some types, for example ReleaseStgMedium clears variables 
  of STGMEDIUM type. All this is documented in <a href="../Other/IDP_MSDN.html">MSDN 
  Library</a>.</p>
<h2>Anonymous types within types</h2>
<p>You probably already know that members of user-defined types can be other 
  user-defined types. Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T1</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>a <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>b
<span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T2</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>x <span class=t>T1</span><span class=p>'</span>y
<span class=t>T2</span> t
t.y.a<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>5</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also possible to define types within types (QM 2.2.0). It can be used 
  to simplify conversion between C++ and QM declarations, because in C++ it is 
  used to define complex unions. These nested types don't have a type name and 
  a member name, but can have specified offset. Their members are accessed directly. 
  To define such nested types, enclose their members in {}. Examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>T2</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>x {<span class=t>int</span>'a <span class=t>int</span>'b}
<span class=t>T2</span> t
t.a<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>5</span>

<span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>LHWORD</span> <span class=t>int</span><span class=p>'</span>i []{<span class=t>word</span>'lo <span class=t>word</span>'hi}
<span class=t>LHWORD</span> lh.i<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>0x00050007</span>
<span class=fq>out</span> <span class=s>&#34;LOWORD is %i, HIWORD is %i&#34;</span> lh.lo lh.hi</pre>
