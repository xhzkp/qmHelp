<h1>Variable storage and scope</h1>

<h2>Local (auto) variables</h2>

<p>Local variables exist only in the function or macro where they are 
  declared. You cannot simply access a variable declared in one function from 
  another function. You can use the same variable name in different functions 
  but it will not be the same variable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Declaration example:</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=t>int</span> i</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Function <a href="IDP_FUNCTION.html">parameters</a> also are local variables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Local variables exist only as long as the function is executing. They are 
  automatically created when entering the function and destroyed when leaving 
  the function. Every executing function instance has its own set of local variables.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Local variables are located on the stack, in order they were declared. They 
  are aligned on 4 bytes (variables of size 1 to 4 occupy 4 bytes, variables of 
  size 5 to 8 occupy 8 bytes, etc). Variables of composite types (str, BSTR, ARRAY, 
  VARIANT, interface pointers) can also have associated data in dynamic memory. 
  Memory allocation is automatic.</p>
<h2>Global (static) variables</h2>
<p>Global variables are shared by all functions and macros of current process (QM or exe). Use global variables to share data between different macros or between 
  different instances of the same macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To declare a global variable, use &quot;<tt>+</tt>&quot; like in this example:</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=t>int</span><span class=o>+</span> g_Variable</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Global variables are created when <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_DEBUG.html">compiling</a> the function or 
  macro where they are declared, and destroyed when closing QM file, eg when QM exits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same global variable can be declared multiple times and in multiple places. 
If you assign a value in the declaration statement (eg <span class=cod><span class=t>int</span><span class=o>+</span> g_v1<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>1</span></span>), the assignment is performed each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Don't use global variables where not necessary. Where possible, use local variables, thread variables, pass variables to functions as arguments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid confusion and conflicts when using multiple global variables, use descriptive names with some name convention, for example add &quot;g_&quot; prefix. To reduce the number of global variables, use <a href="IDP_TYPE.html">user-defined types</a> to store several related variables in a single variable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a global variable can be accessed by multiple <a href="../Other/IDP_THREADS.html">threads</a> simultaneously, use <a href="../Commands/IDP_LOCK.html" class="blue">lock</a> to prevent it, because it is dangerous, may give incorrect results, corrupt memory, make QM unstable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a macro runs in <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html#a8">separate process</a>, it has own global variables. Assume you use global variable g_x in 3 macros. Macro A runs in QM, macros B and C run in separate processes. You cannot use g_x to share data between these 3 macros, because each macro has its own instance of g_x. To share data between these macros you can use <a href="../Functions/IDP_RGET.html">registry</a> or  a file. Programmers can use Windows API functions, for example shared memory. QM has class <span class="type">__SharedMemory</span> to make it simpler.</p>

<h2>Thread variables</h2>

<p>Thread scope is intermediate between local and global. Thread variables are shared between all functions 
  of the same <a href="../Other/IDP_THREADS.html">thread</a> (running macro). 
They must be declared in each function where used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To declare a thread variable, use &quot;<tt>-</tt>&quot; like in this example:</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=t>int</span><span class=o>-</span> t_i</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thread variables are created at run time, at the beginning of the function 
  where first time declared in the thread. They are destroyed when the thread 
exits (macro ends).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you assign a value in the declaration statement, the assignment 
  is performed only the first time during thread execution (differently than local and global 
  variables). Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=cod><span class=t>int</span><span class=o>-</span> t_i<span class=o>=</span><span class=n>5</span> <span class=c2>;;even if this line is encountered sevel times during thread execution, 5 is assigned only the first time</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>See also:</i> <a href="../Other/IDP_THREADS.html">thread variables in special 
  threads</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Private thread variables</h3>

<p>Variables declared with &quot;<tt>--</tt>&quot; are thread 
  variables that are visible only in that function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Declaration example:</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=t>int</span><span class=o>--</span> t_i</pre>
<h2>Member variables and functions</h2>

<p><A href="IDP_CLASSES.html">Class</a> members can be used in all member functions of that class. 
  Instead of <span class=cod>variable.member</span> use just <span class=cod>member</span> or <span class=cod>this.member</span>.</p>

<h2>Sub-function parent variables</h2>

<p><a href="IDP_DIR_SUB.html">Sub-functions</a> with v attribute can use local variables of parent.</p>

<h2>Application variables (obsolete)</h2>

<p>Local variables of the main function of a folder that has <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_FOLDERPROP.html">&quot;Application&quot; 
  property</a> are also visible in other functions of that app folder.</p>

<h2>Scope priority</h2>

<p>If there are two or more visible variables or functions with the same name and different 
  scope, QM uses the one that is the first in this list:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Predefined (<a href="../Reference/IDH_REFERENCE.html">QM language keywords, intrinsic functions</a>, <a href="IDP_SPECVAR.html">special variables/constants</a>, <a href="IDH_VARIABLES.html">intrinsic types</a>, <a href="../_COM/IDP_OLETYPES.html">other QM-defined types</a>). You cannot declare a variable (except class/type member) with the same name as one of predefined 
    names.</li>
  <li>Local and thread variables.</li>
  <li>In <a href="IDP_CLASSES.html">class</a> member functions - members (variables and functions) of this class, then of base classes.</li>
  <li>In sub-functions with v attribute - parent's local variables.</li>
  <li>Application main function's variables (obsolete).</li>
  <li>Global functions, variables, types, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>In class member functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a class member name matches a predefined name, to access the member use <span class=cod>this.member</span>.</li>
  <li>If a class member name matches a global name, to access the global use <span class=cod><span class=lib>__not_this.</span>global</span>. Here <span class="lib">__not_this</span> is a <a href="IDP_CATEGORIES.html">category</a> that has been added in QM 2.4.3 for this purpose, but also can be used any category name.</li>
</ul>
