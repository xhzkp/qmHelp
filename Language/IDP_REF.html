<h3>Remarks</h3>
<h4>Syntax1</h4>

<p>Declare file or macro where QM will look for declarations. Can be anywhere, 
  not necessary in the same macro where used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Syntax2</h4>
<p>Makes identifiers from a somewhere declared reference file or macro available 
  in current macro without specifying <b>refname</b>. Also, if the file is still 
  not loaded, loads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reference files/macros can contain declarations of types (<a href="IDP_TYPE.html" class="blue">type</a>, 
  <span class="blue">class</span>, <span class="blue">category</span>), constants 
  (<a href="IDP_DEF.html" class="blue">def</a>), dll functions (<a href="IDP_DLL.html" class="blue">dll</a>), 
  COM interfaces (<a href="../_COM/IDP_INTERFACE.html" class="blue">interface</a>) 
  and type libraries (<a href="../_COM/IDP_TYPELIB.html" class="blue">typelib</a>). 
  The declarations are in QM format. Each declaration starts from the beginning 
  of a line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose is the same as of type libraries (<a href="../_COM/IDP_TYPELIB.html" class="blue">typelib</a>) 
  or <a href="IDP_DIR_COMPILE.html" class="dir">#compile</a>: declare various 
  identifiers (constants, dll functions, types, etc) so that you don't have to 
  do it when you want to use them. Unlike type libraries, reference files can 
  be used only in QM. Unlike <span class="dir">#compile</span>, <span class="blue">ref</span> 
  does not compile whole file/macro. For example, if you compile a macro that 
  contains declarations of dll functions, dll files are immediately loaded into 
  memory. With <span class="blue">ref</span>, dll is loaded only when (if) it 
  is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM 2.2.0. A reference file/macro (lets call it <i>file1</i>) also can contain 
  references to other reference files/macros (<i>file2</i>). In file2 QM will 
  look for declarations of identifiers that are used in declarations in file1 
  but not declared in file1. To add such a reference, add <span class=cod><span class=fq>ref</span> refname</span> line in file1. Also declare file2 somewhere in macros, using 
  syntax1, before or after of file1 declaration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A declaration in a reference file/macro can be followed by comments in the 
  next line. Comments will be displayed in QM status bar. The line must begin 
  with single space and two semicolons. Declarations should not have comments 
  in the same line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Accessing identifiers declared in a reference file</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a reference file is declared with global scope (flag 2), identifiers from 
  it can be used anywhere, without any special syntax. Otherwise use
  syntax <span class=syntax><span class="lib">refname</span>.identifier</span>, 
  unless the reference file is declared in the same macro/function. Also, when using <span class=syntax><span class="lib">refname</span>.identifier</span> 
  syntax, identifier is automatically declared and colored when typing or opening 
  macro.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Existing reference files</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick Macros comes with several reference files containing Windows API and 
  other declarations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> WINAPI - mostly used Windows XP API declarations. It is declared 
  with flag 2 (global scope) and therefore you can use Windows API simply, without 
  prepending <span class=cod><span class=lib>WINAPI.</span></span>. That is why you can use Windows 
  API without declaring them. That is why when you type or click an identifier 
  (type, function, etc), its declaration is displayed in QM status bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The file has been updated in QM 2.3.0. To create it was used Vista SDK v6.0 
  headers/libraries and preproccessor definitions for Windows 2003 and Internet 
  Explorer 6 (WINVER 0x0502, _WIN32_IE 0x0603). The old file (QM 2.2.0-2.2.1) 
  was created from older header files and therefore there are some changes. If 
  you upgraded QM from an older version, you can still find the old file in QM 
  folder. The old file is named winapiqm.txt. The new file is winapi.txt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINAPIV - declarations specific to Windows Vista. To avoid conflicts, it is 
  declared not as global, and therefore functions and other identifiers can be 
  accessed only like  <span class=cod><span class=lib>WINAPIV.</span>Function</span>. The 
  file has been added in QM 2.3.0. To create it was used Vista SDK v6.0 headers/libraries 
  and preproccessor definitions for Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7 (WINVER 
  0x0600, _WIN32_IE 0x0700).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINAPI7 - declarations specific to Windows 7. To avoid conflicts, it is declared 
  not as global, and therefore functions and other identifiers can be accessed 
  only like <span class=cod><span class=lib>WINAPIV.</span>Function</span>. The file has 
  been added in QM 2.3.1. To create it was used Windows 7 SDK v7.0 headers/libraries 
  and preproccessor definitions for Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 (WINVER 
  0x0601, _WIN32_IE 0x0800).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINAPI, WINAPIV and WINAPI7 contain declarations from <a onClick="doSection(e1)" class="expand">these header files</a>. </p>

<p> You can <a href="http://www.quickmacros.com/download.html" target="_blank">download</a> file WINAPI2 that contains 
  more declarations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Using with distributed macros</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you create macros for distributing, in them you should not use identifiers 
  from reference files, unless you are sure that others have the same reference 
  files. For example, WINAPI has been updated in QM 2.2.0 and in QM 2.3.0. If 
  you use identifiers from it in your macros, other people that use other QM versions 
  may get &quot;unknown identifier&quot; errors. You should rather extract these 
  declarations from the reference file and place them in the macros. All this 
  is not actual if the macros are compiled to <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a>. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Extracting and logging declarations</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To extract a single declaration from a reference file or macro, type or click the identifier 
  (e.g. function name) in the editor and do one of the following: 1. Ctrl+click 
  the identifier and copy declaration from output. 2. Copy declaration from status bar, or press Alt+F8 to transfer it from status bar to output. 3. Press 
  F2 and copy declaration from file. Also, to extract multiple declarations (except 
  from macros), you can use menu Run 
  -&gt; Compile Options-&gt; Show declarations from ref files. Then used declarations 
  that are found in reference files are displayed in the output. A declaration 
  is displayed when the identifier is first time used in a macro that you run 
  or compile, or first time displayed in code when you use syntax <span class=syntax><span class="lib">refname</span>.identifier</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Errors in declarations</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes may happen that some declaration in reference file fails, for example, 
  due to a missing dll or type library. In such case, file is opened, and statement 
  highlighted. If you want that on error would be executed some user-defined function, 
  place  <span class=cod><span class=dir>#err</span> <span class=fq>function</span></span>  in reference file, immediately after declaration. If function returns nonzero 
  value, error is not shown, and compilation stops. If returns negative value, 
  &quot;unknown identifier&quot; error also is not shown.</p>
