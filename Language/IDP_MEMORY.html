<h1>Memory allocation functions</h1>
<p>Normally, memory for variables is allocated automatically. Alternatively, you 
  can allocate variables in dynamic memory (heap) using these functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These functions can be used to allocate and free memory for variables of any 
  types, including composite types (str, VARIANT, etc) and types that have constructors/destructors. 
  They are similar to C++ operators <span class="blue">new</span> and <span class="blue">delete</span>. 
  To simply allocate memory also can be used <a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html">dll 
  functions</a> or <a href="../str/IDP_S_ALL.html">str variables</a>. See also <a href="../_COM/IDP_OLE_ARRAY.html">safe 
  arrays</a>.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class=syntax>p._new(<i>[</i>count<i>]</i>)

p._resize(<i>[</i>count<i>]</i>)

p._delete

<i>int</i> p._len</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<div class="parts">
<p> <b>p</b> - pointer variable of any type.</p>

<p> <b>count</b> - number of elements. For <span class="blue">_new</span>, default 
is 1. For <span class="blue">_resize</span>, default is plus 1, and can be negative 
to add -<b>count</b> elements.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<p><span class="blue">_new</span> allocates memory for single variable or array 
  of type of <b>p</b>. All bytes are set to 0. If the type has constructor, it 
  is called for each element. The function sets <b>p</b> to point to the first 
  element. Returns reference to <b>p</b>. When the memory is not needed anymore, 
  it must be freed using function <span class="blue">_delete</span>. The function 
  does not free previously allocated memory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="blue">_resize</span> resizes memory to hold more or less elements. 
  Whole or part of previous content is preserved. If <b>count</b> is greater than 
  previous number of elements, the added memory is initialized in same way as 
  with <span class="blue">_new</span>. If <b>count</b> is less, the deleted elements 
  are freed in same way as with <span class="blue">_delete</span>. Variable <b>p</b> 
  must point to memory allocated with <span class="blue">_new</span> or <span class="blue">_resize</span>, 
  or be 0. The function sets <b>p</b> to point to the first element of resized 
  and possibly moved memory block. Returns reference to <b>p</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="blue">_delete</span> frees memory and sets <b>p</b> to 0. If the 
  type has destructor, it is called for each element. Elements of str and other 
  composite types also are properly cleaned. Variable <b>p</b> must point to memory 
  allocated with <span class="blue">_new</span> or <span class="blue">_resize</span>, 
  or be 0. The function returns reference to <b>p</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="blue">_len</span> returns number of elements in array. Variable 
  <b>p</b> must point to memory allocated with <span class="blue">_new</span> 
  or <span class="blue">_resize</span>, or be 0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory allocated using these functions is not automatically freed when the 
  pointer variable is destroyed. You must use <span class="blue">_delete</span> 
  to free it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a pointer variable uses these functions, it cannot use other memory-allocation 
  functions, and vice versa.</p>
