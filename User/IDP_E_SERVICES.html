<h1>AR Services Manager Library 1.03</h1>

<p class="red">Obsolete. Does not work on Windows 10/11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This library manages Windows services. It is a COM component.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2" align="center"><strong>clsServices<br>
    </strong>This class can be used to list and access services in a system. You
    can specify what type of services to want to have listed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">Properties:<ul>
      <li>ComputerName. By default, this property is
        set to the name of the computer in which the library is running. You can specify the name
        of another computer to access the services running there.</li>
      <li>Count. Number of services listed.</li>
      <li>Item(Index). This property will take
        you to a clsService object that contains the properties and the methods to access the
        service specified. You can specify a service by putting the number that is has in the
        collection or by passing its name.</li>
      <li>ServicesEnumState. The possible
        values for this property are: Active Services, Both Active and Inactive Services or
        Inactive Services. Specify here what type of services you want to list. The library will
        update itself if this property is changed.</li>
      <li>ServicesEnumType. The possible
        values for this property are: WIN32 Services, Kernel and File System Drivers or Both WIN32
        and Drivers. Specify here what type of services you want to have listed. The library will
        update itself if this property is changed.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">Methods:<ul>
      <li>Delete(Index). Pass the number that a
        service has in the collection or the name of a service to delete it. The method returns
        True (nonzero) if successful or False (0) if there was an error. After you delete a service, it is not
        immediately removed from the services, if it has references to it. If you try to call the
        function again after you got True (successful), the method will return False.</li>
      <li>Refresh. Call this method to refresh the
        contents of the object. Returns True if successful or False if there was an error.</li>

<div align="center">

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2" align="center"><strong>clsService<br>
    </strong>This class is returned by the clsServices class (one per service
    listed), but you can also use it independently to access a specific system, in the local
    machine or through a network. To access a specific service, just set the name or the
    display name of the service you want to access. The class will update itself automatically
    with the information of the service. Using this class you can also start, stop, pause or
    continue services.<br>
    <i>(r/w) means read/write property; (r-o) means read-only property.</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top" rowspan="2">Properties:<ul>
            <li>AutoUpdate (r/w). If this property is 
              True (nonzero), when you tell the service to change its state (stop it, start 
              it, pause it...) the library will start checking for the state of 
              the service till its state changes completely or till the time specified 
              in AutoUpdateTimeOut expires. This is because usually a service 
              doesn't change its state immediately, but needs some time for processing. 
              Therefore, before when you changed the state of a service, the CurrentState 
              property passed to something like 'Start Pending', and after that 
              you had to refresh the state manually. This property is automatically 
              True if you are using this class independently, and automatically 
            False if you are accessing from a clsServices class.</li>
      <li>AutoUpdateInterval (r/w). How often the
        library will refresh the status of the service, given in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>AutoUpdateTimeOut (r/w). If the service
        doesn't change its status, for how long the library should keep refreshing its contents,
        in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>BinaryPathName (r/w). Path to the binary file of the
        service.</li>
      <li>CheckPoint.</li>
      <li>ComputerName (r/w). By default, this
        property is empty if you are using this class independently, or has the same value as the
        class clsServices is this class is an item of the other. You can specify another name to
        access a service in another computer.</li>
      <li>ControlsAccepted (r-o).
        Possible values are: Accept Pause &amp; Continue, Accept Shutdown or Accept Stop. Also, it
        could be any combination of these values. To know if a service accepts a certain control,
        use operator &amp;. Example: if(Svc.ControlsAccepted&amp;Accept_Stop_20).</li>
      <li>CurrentState (r/w). Possible
        values are: Continue Pending, Pause Pending, Paused, Running, Start Pending, Stop Pending
        or Stopped. You can also set this property to Start, Stop or Pause to modify the state of
        the service.</li>
      <li>Dependencies (r/w). This
        property will return an object that contains the dependencies of the service, if any. You
        can also create this class independently and set it to this property to change the
        dependencies of the service.</li>
      <li>DisplayName (r/w). Display name for the
        service (those you can see in the services control manager). If you change this property,
        the class will look for another service that has that display name, and if it finds it, it
        will update itself with the information of that service.</li>
      <li>LoadOrderGroup (r/w).</li>
      <li>Name (r/w). Internal name of the service.
        You can change this property to the name of other service, and the class will update
        itself with the configuration of that service.</li>
      <li>Password (r/w). You can use this property
        to change the password of the account under which a service is run. If you do it, this
        property will also contain that password if the change is successful. If it is not, or you
        haven't changed the password, this property will be empty (what doesn't mean that the
        account doesn't have any password).</li>
      <li>ServiceSpecificExitCode (r-o).</li>
      <li>ServiceType (r/w). Possible values
        are: File System Driver, Kernel Driver, WIN32 Own Process, WIN32 Share Process,
        Interactive WIN32 Own Process or Interactive WIN32 Share Process.</li>
      <li>StartErrorSeverity (r/w).
        Possible values are: Ignore Error, Normal Error, Severe Error ore Critical Error. Informs
        on how there server will act if an error ocurres at startup.</li>
      <li>StartName (r/w). Depending on the type of service,
        this can be the name of the account under which the service is running.</li>
      <li>StartType (r/w). Possible values are:
        Auto Start, Boot Start, Demand Start, Disabled, System Start. Indicates how the service is
        started.</li>
      <li>TagID (r/w).</li>
      <li>WaitHint (r-o).</li>
      <li>Win32ExitCode (r-o).</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">Methods:<ul>
      <li>ChangeAccount(strUserID, strPassword, [strDomain]). If you want to change the account under which a
        WIN32_OWN_Process service is run, you can't use the StartName and Password properties
        independently, since both must be changed at the same time. Use this method instead.</li>
      <li>ChangeDisplayName(strDisplayName). You can't use the DisplayName property because if you change it, the class will
        just look for another service with that display name, instead of changing that property
        for the current service. Use this method instead.</li>
      <li>ContinueService. Use this method to
        continue the service if it is paused. Returns True of successful or False if an error
        ocurred.</li>
      <li>PauseService.Use this method to pause a
        service if it is running. Returns True of successful or False if an error ocurred.</li>
      <li>StartService. Use this method to start a
        service if it is stopped. Returns True of successful or False if an error ocurred.</li>
      <li>StopService. Use this method to stop a
        service if it is running. Returns True of successful or False if an error ocurred.</li>
      <li>Refresh. Forces the library to update the information
        about the service. Returns True of successful or False if an error ocurred.</li>
