<h1> Prevent simultaneous execution of  code by multiple threads</h1>

<h3>Syntax1 - lock</h3>

<pre class=syntax><b>lock</b><i> [</i>name<i>] [</i>mutex<i>] [</i>timeoutMS<i>]</i></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Syntax2 - unlock</h3>
<pre class=syntax><b>lock</b>- <i>[</i>name<i>]</i></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<div class="parts">
<p> <b>name</b><b></b> - name of this lock. Must be like a <a href="../Other/IDP_IDENTIFIERS.html">variable 
name</a>, without quotes. Used to identify the same lock in multiple 
functions (or macros, etc). Can be omitted or literal 0 if this lock is 
used only in current function.</p>
<p><b>mutex</b> - mutex name. String. Case sensitive. Can contain any characters 
except \. Can have &quot;Global\&quot; or &quot;Local\&quot; prefix. Read more 
in remarks.</p>
<p><b>timeoutMS</b> - max time (milliseconds) to wait in case another thread is executing 
locked code. Integer. On timeout throws error that can be handled by <a href="../Flow/IDP_ERR.html" class="blue">err</a>. 
If omitted or -1, waits infinitely. To just check whether the code is locked, 
use 0.</p>
</div>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<p>Added in QM 2.2.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../Other/IDP_THREADS.html">thread</a> is a running function or 
  macro. Multiple threads can run simultaneously. It means that two or more threads 
  can execute the same code block at the same time. Sometimes it is important 
  to prevent this. For example, if one thread is writing to a file (e.g. using 
  str.setfile), another thread would fail to open the file at that time. Or, if 
  one thread is modifying a global variable, the value of the variable may become 
  incorrect if another thread also modifies it at the same time. Use <span class="blue">lock</span> 
  to avoid this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Syntax1</h4>
<p>Locks the following block of code (code from <span class="blue">lock</span> 
  to <span class="blue">lock</span>- or to the end of the function). It means 
  that the code cannot be executed by more than one thread at a time. If thread2 
  wants to execute the code while thread1 is executing it, thread2 waits until 
  thread1 finishes executing the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Syntax2</h4>
<p>Unlocks the code block that was locked by <span class="blue">lock</span>. Unlocking 
  in many cases is not necessary. QM automatically unlocks the code when the function 
  exits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If <b>name</b> was used with <span class="blue">lock</span>, use the same name 
  with <span class="blue">lock</span>-.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="blue">lock</span>- unlocks the code only if <span class="blue">lock</span>- was actually executed. 
  For example, if you <span class="blue">goto</span> somewhere without executing 
  <span class="blue">lock</span>-, the code remains locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the same named lock (the same <b>name</b>) in multiple functions. 
  For example, while one thread is executing locked code in function1, other threads 
  also will not be able to execute locked code in function2 if the code is locked 
  with the same named lock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't use multiple <span class="blue">lock</span> without <span class="blue">lock</span>-. 
  The lock count is incremented (by 1) by <span class="blue">lock</span> and decremented 
  (by 1) by <span class="blue">lock</span>- and when the function exits. If the 
  lock count is more than 1 when the function exits, all code locked by that lock 
  object remains locked. To reset, you can execute <span class="blue">lock</span>- 
  somewhere else, or restart QM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be careful using <span class="blue">lock</span>. Two threads can lock each 
  other, causing both to wait forever. Example: Thread1 is executing locked code 
  and sends message to a window of thread2. Thread2 receives the message and tries 
  to execute the same code (or other code locked by the same named lock). Result: 
  Thread1 waits in <span class="dll">SendMessage</span> (because thread2 waits 
  in <span class="blue">lock</span>), and thread2 waits in <span class="blue">lock</span> 
  (because thread1 waits in <span class="dll">SendMessage</span>). To reset, restart 
  QM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While waiting in <span class="blue">lock</span>, the thread does not process 
  messages, even if <span class="blue">opt</span> waitmsg 1 used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If <b>mutex</b> is omitted or &quot;&quot;, the lock synchronizes only 
  threads in current process (running program, ie QM or exe). With mutex 
  it can synchronize threads in multiple processes. It can be useful, for example, 
  if 'Run in separate process' is checked (see <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a>). <span class="blue">lock</span> creates or opens the mutex. The mutex name must be an unique string, like &quot;QM_mutex_macroname_8469&quot;. 
  Error if a kernel object of other type with the same name exists in the system. 
  A mutex with &quot;Global\&quot; prefix can be used by processes in multiple 
  user sessions. 
  With mutex <span class="blue">lock</span> is about 8 times slower. You can read more about mutexes and other kernel synchronization objects in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amicrosoft.com synchronization objects" target="_blank">MSDN library</a>.</p>
