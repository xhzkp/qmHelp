  <td><p>Use default synchronization method.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The macro waits when sent keys are actually received by the target window. 
      Since there is no completely reliable way to know this, it waits only 
      for a limited time period. It also waits while the window is busy. This 
      method is fast and reliable in most cases. However in certain conditions 
      it may be slower.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a>, uses method 2 instead. 
      Waiting until the target window actually receives sent keys is not supported 
      in exe, because it is too expensive (uses hooks in dll).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here &quot;in exe&quot; actually means &quot;in exe, if QM is not running&quot;. 
      If QM is running, all synchronization methods work in exe like in QM.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A special synchronization method is used if the target window belongs 
  to the same thread.</p></td>
  <td><p>1 - Don't use synchronization. The keys are sent without waiting until 
      the window actually receives them. Fastest. Should not be used if not 
      using <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_SETT_TRIGGERS.html">low level hooks</a> 
      (unless in exe), because it can create problems with keyboard triggers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2 - Use minimal synchronization. This method is used by default in exe. 
      The macro only waits while the target window is busy. The synchronization 
      does not work well (keys may be sent too fast) with some windows and in 
      stress conditions (low memory, busy CPU, etc). Slowest in most cases (about 
      20-100 %). Should not be used if not using low level hooks (unless in 
      exe), because it can create problems with keyboard triggers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>3 - Use maximal synchronization. The macro waits until the 
      key is received by the target window. Since there is no completely reliable 
      way to know this, in some cases the macro can wait infinitely. 
      Therefore this method should not be used in macros designed to work in 
    any window. Exe uses method 2 instead.</p></td>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<p><i>Syntax1:</i> Changes a run-time option locally (only for current instance of running function 
  or macro).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If used as function, <span class="blue">opt</span> is identical to <a href="../Functions/IDP_GETOPT.html" class="blue">getopt</a> 
  (returns current value).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially all options are 0, except keymark in autotexts. Some initial options can be changed with <a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#RtOptions" class="dll">RtOptions</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> waitmsg <span class=n>1</span></span> should be used if you use wait commands (explicit or implicit, e.g. 
  autodelay or clipboard commands) in thread (running macro) that has a window 
  (or dialog). While waiting, window must process messages. Without this option, 
  it cannot process messages. This causes various anomalies, such as window not 
  responding, etc. This option also is often necessary when working with COM, 
  especially with events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macros that contain <span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> waitcpu <span class=n>1</span></span>  sometimes may run very slowly, because some 
  programs constantly use CPU.  To see CPU usage, use Windows Task Manager or perfmon.exe. You can also use  <a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#GetCPU" class="dll">GetCPU</a> function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About <span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> keymark <span class=n>1</span></span>: 
  For keyboard triggers and some other features, QM uses keyboard hooks to intercept 
  keyboard events. QM processes QM-pressed (<i>injected</i>) keys differently 
  than user-pressed (<i>real</i>) keys. For example, a macro cannot trigger a 
  hotkey macro using the <span class="blue">key</span> command. However, when 
  the user presses or releases a key simultaneously with the <span class="blue">key</span> 
  command, QM processes the key event like generated by the <span class="blue">key</span> 
  command (there is no reliable way to distinguish real and injected keys, unless 
  you use low level hook). If it is a trigger-key, the trigger will not work. 
  If it is a wait-key (<span class=cod><span class=fq>wait</span> <span class=n>0</span> K</span>), the macro will not 
  stop waiting. Also, user-pressed keys may be inserted (typed) between QM-pressed 
  keys. There are two ways to avoid all these problems: 1. Use <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_SETT_TRIGGERS.html">low 
  level keyboard hook</a>. 2. Insert <span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> keymark <span class=n>1</span></span> before <span class="blue">key</span>. However then in some windows some keys may not work as expected. 
  When using low level keyboard hook, <span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> keymark <span class=n>1</span></span> does not change anything (everything works well with or without 
  it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM 2.4.1. Added <i>Syntax2</i> for saving/restoring current <span class="blue">opt</span> and <a href="IDP_SPE.html" class="blue">spe</a> settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> save</span> remembers current settings (adds to an internal stack).</li>
  <li><span class=cod><span class=fq>opt</span> restore</span> restores the saved settings (gets/removes from the stack).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM 2.4.3. Disabled opt end. Not error if used, but now it does nothing.</p>
