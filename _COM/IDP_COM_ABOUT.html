<h1>About COM</h1>

<p>The Component Object Model (COM) is a standard for creating binary software 
  components that can interact. It enables one applications (clients) to use capabilities 
  of other applications and other software components (servers).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents), 
  ActiveX&reg; (Internet-enabled components), as well as others. Automation (OLE 
  automation) is COM-based technology that enables applications to provide objects 
  in a consistent way to other applications, development tools, and macro languages. 
  Part of Windows operating system features, that programmers can use, is based 
  on COM, and cannot be accessed with Windows API (<A href="../Language/IDP_DLL.html" class="blue">dll</a>) 
  functions. Some applications also provide COM objects. For example, you can 
  use Excel capabilities from QM. You can also use standalone ActiveX components 
  that can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, a COM object is made up of a set of data and the functions that 
  manipulate the data. These function sets are called <i>interfaces,</i> and the 
  functions of an interface are called <i>methods </i>and <i> properties.</i> 
  These functions can be accessed only through a pointer to the interface (in 
  QM known as <i>interface pointer</i> variable).</p>
