<h1>QM identifier names (naming conventions)</h1>
<p>Names of identifiers (QM keywords, variables, functions, types, etc) are case 
  sensitive and can contain only alphanumeric characters (a to z, A to Z, 0 to 
  9) and underscore ( _ ). First character cannot be digit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Identifier name must be unique in its scope:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Name of a local variable must be unique in that function or macro. If a local 
  variable has same name as user-defined global identifier, is used local variable. 
  Different functions or macros can have local variables with same name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global identifier names must be unique in that <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_QML.html">QM file</a>. All identifiers, except local and thread variables, are global.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not error to declare a global identifier more than once, if declarations 
  are identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
When QM searches for an identifier, it does it in the following sequence: at first 
searches for QM-defined identifiers (QM intrinsic functions, predefined types, 
constants and variables), then for local and thread variables, members (in a member 
function only), application variables, user-defined global identifiers, and finally 
in type libraries and reference files.
