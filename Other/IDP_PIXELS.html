<h1>
Coordinates</h1>

<p>Many functions (<span class="blue">lef</span>, <span class="blue">rig</span>, 
  <span class="blue">mid</span>, <span class="blue">dou</span>, <span class="blue">mou</span>, 
  <span class="blue">win</span>, <span class="blue">child</span>, <span class="blue">pixel</span>, 
  <span class="blue">mov</span>, <span class="blue">siz</span>, <span class="blue">wait</span>) 
  use coordinates <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> to specify a point in the screen or a 
  window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With mouse commands, <span class="blue">pixel</span> and <span class="blue">wait</span>, 
  if <b>window</b> is omitted or literal 0, coordinates are relative to the 
  top-left corner of the screen or the work area. Otherwise, they are relative 
  to the window or to the client area of the window. Window's client area includes 
  all except border, caption bar, scroll bars and standard menu bar. The work 
  area is the portion of the screen not obscured by the system taskbar or by application 
  desktop toolbars. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If coordinates are integer values, they are interpreted as number of pixels. 
  A pixel is the smallest unit that can be displayed on a monitor. It depends 
  on screen resolution. For example, resolution of 1024x768 means 1024 pixels 
  in horizontal and 768 pixels in vertical. When you move the mouse, in QM 
  status bar you can see mouse pointer coordinates in pixels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If coordinates have type of double (usually from 0.0 to 0.999) then they are 
  interpreted as fraction of the screen, window, client area or child window. 
  For example, <span class=cod><span class=fq>mou</span> <span class=n>0.5</span> <span class=n>0.5</span> <span class=fq>child</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s>&#34;OK&#34;</span> <span class=s>&#34;Button&#34;</span> <span class=s>&#34;Message&#34;</span><span class=p>)</span></span> moves the mouse to the middle 
  of OK button. Double coordinates cannot be used with user-defined and dll functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually screen coordinates must be relative to the primary monitor. If you 
  want to use coordinates relative to some other monitor, use function <span class="UDF">XyMonitorToNormal</span> 
  to convert them.</p>
