<h1> Setup command line parameters</h1>
<p>The Setup program accepts optional command line parameters. These can be useful 
  to system administrators, and to other programs calling the Setup program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/SP-</p>
<p> Disables the This will install... Do you wish to continue? prompt at the beginning 
  of Setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/SILENT, /VERYSILENT</p>
<p> Instructs Setup to be silent or very silent. When Setup is silent the wizard 
  and the background window are not displayed but the installation progress window 
  is. When a setup is very silent this installation progress window is not displayed. 
  Everything else is normal so for example error messages during installation 
  are displayed and the startup prompt is (if you haven't disabled it with the 
  '/SP-' command line option explained above).</p>
<p>If a restart is necessary and the '/NORESTART' command isn't used (see below) 
  and Setup is silent, it will display a Reboot now? message box. If it's very 
  silent it will reboot without asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/LOG</p>
<p> Causes Setup to create a log file in the user's TEMP directory detailing file 
  installation actions taken during the installation process. This can be a helpful 
  debugging aid. For example, if you suspect a file isn't being replaced when 
  you believe it should be (or vice versa), the log file will tell you if the 
  file was really skipped, and why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/NOCANCEL</p>
<p> Prevents the user from cancelling during the installation process, by disabling 
  the Cancel button and ignoring clicks on the close button. Useful along with 
  '/SILENT' or '/VERYSILENT'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/NORESTART</p>
<p> Instructs Setup not to reboot even if it's necessary. Rebooting may be necessary 
  only when reinstalling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/RESTARTEXITCODE=exit code</p>
<p> Specifies the custom exit code that Setup is to return when a restart is needed. 
  Useful along with '/NORESTART'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/LOADINF=&quot;filename&quot;</p>
<p>  Instructs Setup to load the settings from the specified file after having checked 
  the command line. This file can be prepared using the '/SAVEINF=' command as 
  explained below. Don't forget to use quotes if the filename contains spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/SAVEINF=&quot;filename&quot;</p>
<p>  Instructs Setup to save installation settings to the specified file. Don't forget 
  to use quotes if the filename contains spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/DIR=&quot;x:\dirname&quot;</p>
<p>  Overrides the default directory name displayed on the Select Destination Location 
  wizard page. A fully qualified pathname must be specified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/GROUP=&quot;folder name&quot;</p>
<p>  Overrides the default folder name displayed on the Select Start Menu Folder 
  wizard page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/NOICONS</p>
<p> Instructs Setup to initially check the Don't create any icons check box on the 
  Select Start Menu Folder wizard page.</p>
