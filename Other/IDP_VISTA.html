<h1>Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, 11; Windows 64-bit</h1>

<h2>User Account Control</h2>
<p>Windows Vista and later has a security feature - <i>User Account Control (UAC)</i>. 
  With UAC, even on administrator accounts most processes (running programs) have 
  limited privileges. It creates problems for many programs. This topic describes 
  problems that may have QM because of UAC, and gives workarounds for most 
  of them. You also may want to read about running <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">QM-created 
  programs</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If UAC is on, there are several predefined privilege sets, known as <i>integrity 
  level</i>s (IL). An IL is assigned to a process (running program) before starting 
  it, and cannot be changed while it is running. The table gives some information 
  about different integrity levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table class="tnormal">
  <tr> 
    <th>IL</th>
    <th>Comments</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>High</td>
    <td><p>The process runs as administrator.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> When starting a process that needs administrator privileges, usually 
        is shown a dialog with name &quot;User Account Control&quot; <i>(consent</i> 
        dialog). The process then is called <i>elevated</i>. The program can be 
        marked to require such privileges, or you can run it as administrator 
        using the right-click menu, or you can set it to run as administrator 
        in file properties dialog, or if Windows decides that it is a setup program. 
        A process launched by a process that has administrator privileges also 
        has administrator privileges, but does not require a consent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>By default, QM runs with High IL (as administrator), although you can 
        change it in Options. To create better user experience, a consent dialog 
        is not shown when QM starts. Otherwise QM would be blocked at Windows 
        startup. Also, processes launched by QM have Medium IL by default.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td><p>The process runs as standard user, like on a non-administrator account. 
        It has limited privileges. For example, It cannot write to Windows and 
        Program Files folders, cannot write to most registry keys, cannot manipulate 
        services, and much more. Also, it cannot interact (use keyboard, mouse 
        and menu commands, send messages, use hooks, etc) with higher IL processes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Most processes have Medium IL. Windows Explorer too. QM runs with Medium IL if in Options is selected UAC: run as User, 
        which is not recommended.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>uiAccess</td>
    <td><p>The process has Medium IL, but is allowed to interact (use keyboard, 
        mouse and menu commands, send messages, use hooks, etc) with High IL and 
        uiAccess processes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Only few programs have uiAccess privileges. QM runs with uiAccess privileges 
        if in Options is selected UAC: run as uiAccess, which is recommended if 
        you don't want QM running as administrator. On non-administrator accounts, 
        QM runs as uiAccess by default.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Low</td>
    <td>The process has minimal privileges. It can write only to several predefined 
      folders and registry keys. Normally, with Low IL runs only Internet Explorer, 
      when protected mode is on. QM does not have an option to run as Low, but 
      macros that are set to run in separate process can run as Low.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>System</td>
    <td>Highest privileges. Normally only services and some system processes 
      run with System IL. QM does not have an option to run as System.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. What IL uses QM? Can it be changed?</p>
<p>A. By default QM runs as administrator. It can be changed in Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. Should QM run as administrator, uiAccess, or standard user? When it has 
  less problems with UAC?</p>
<p>A. QM has less problems when it runs as administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. Is it safe if QM runs as administrator?</p>
<p>A. It is quite safe. Programs started by QM (<span class="blue">run</span>) 
  have medium IL. If you think it is not safe, you can set it to run as uiAccess. 
  The User mode (Medium IL) is not recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. Can some macros run with different IL than QM?</p>
<p>A. Yes, if they run in separate process. You can set it in Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. Is it possible to turn off UAC?</p>
<p>A. Yes, you can completely turn off UAC in Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts. 
  Some options can be changed in local security policy (run &quot;secpol.msc&quot;). 
  For example, you can set to elevate without consent, or to show consent in default 
  desktop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Q. Is it possible to run a program as administrator without a consent dialog?</p>
<p>A. Use flag 0x10000 or 0x20000 with <span class="blue">run</span>. Or use function 
  <a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#StartProcess" class="dll">StartProcess</a>. Or, in macro 
  properties, check &quot;Run in separate process&quot; and select &quot;Administrator&quot; 
  or &quot;Highest available&quot;. It is possible only from QM (except portable). Without QM, it 
  is possible for example using Windows Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q. Is it possible to automatically close the consent dialog for some programs?</p>
<p>A. There is no such option in Windows. QM also cannot automate it because the 
  dialog is created in a secure desktop. If the dialog is not in a secure desktop 
  (you can set it in local security policy), then you can create a function that 
  closes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find more information about UAC on the Internet. 
  If you need QM-specific information, you can ask about it in QM 
  <A href="http://www.quickmacros.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>

<h2>What does not work because of UAC</h2>
<p>These problems are common to all integrity levels.</p>
<ol>
  <li>May fail file functions that use mapped network drive (like &quot;Z:\file&quot;). Workaround: Use  path like &quot;\\server\share\file&quot;.</li>
  <li>And maybe more (not yet discovered).</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve most other UAC-related problems, you can set QM or separate macros 
  to run with appropriate IL. The information below should help you decide what 
IL you should use.</p>
<h2>What does not work when QM is running as Administrator or uiAccess</h2>
<p>Some operations are not allowed between different IL processes. Although most 
  of them are not allowed only when initiated by the lower IL process, some of 
  them also are not allowed when initiated by the higher IL process.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <span class="blue">_getactive</span>, GetObject (VBScript) and some other 
    COM functions cannot get COM objects from different IL processes. <span class="blue">_getactive</span> 
    also is used in some other functions. Possible workarounds: 1. In Properties, check &quot;Run 
    in separate process&quot; and select same privileges as of the target app 
    (usually User). 2. Start the target app using <span class="blue">_create</span>. 
    3. Run both QM and the target app as administrator. 4. Turn off UAC.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop from Medium IL processes (e.g. Windows Explorer) to QM. QM uses 
    another process to reenable its drag and drop feature. However, WM_DROPFILES 
    in custom dialogs does not work. Possible workarounds: 1. Use <a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#QmRegisterDropTarget" class="dll">QmRegisterDropTarget</a> 
    instead. 2. In Properties, check &quot;Run in separate process&quot; and select 
    User. 3. Turn off UAC.</li>
  <li>And maybe more.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What does not work when QM is running as User or uiAccess</h2>
<p>Some functions and other QM features require administrator privileges. If QM 
  (or <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a>) is not running as administrator, 
  these features don't work.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Writing to some file system locations, such as Program Files and Windows 
    folders (<span class="blue">cop</span>, <span class="blue">ren</span>, <span class="blue">del</span>, 
    <span class="UDF">MkDir</span>, <span class="UDF">SetAttr</span>, str.setfile, 
    etc).</li>
  <li>Writing to some registry keys, such as HKEY_LOCAL_SYSTEM and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT 
    (<span class="blue">rset</span>).</li>
  <li>Automatic COM object registration by <a href="../_COM/IDP_COM_FUNC.html">_create</a> 
    (because cannot write to the registry).</li>
  <li><a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#RegisterComComponent" class="dll">RegisterComComponent</a>. You can use flag 4 to show 
    consent dialog.</li>
  <li><a href="../User/IDP_QMDLL.html#SetPrivilege" class="dll">SetPrivilege</a>.</li>
  <li>Manipulating services.</li>
  <li>Changing computer date.</li>
  <li>Some COM functions, including <span class="blue">_getactive</span> and GetObject 
    (VBScript), don't work with different IL processes. Read more above.</li>
  <li>On Windows 8 QM does not see Windows store app windows.</li>
  <li>And maybe more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything above also does not work on non-administrator user accounts on all 
OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible workarounds: 1. In Properties, check &quot;Run in separate process&quot; 
  and select Administrator. 2. Run QM as administrator. 3. Turn off UAC.</p>
<h2>What does not work when QM is running as User</h2>
<p>The following functions don't work with higher IL windows unless QM (or <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">exe</a>) 
  is running as administrator or uiAccess. This is more actual for exe, because 
  QM can run as administrator or uiAccess.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Keyboard and mouse commands (<span class="blue">key</span>, <span class="blue">paste</span>/<span class="blue">outp</span>, 
    str.getsel, str.setsel, <span class="blue">lef</span>, <span class="blue">mou</span>, 
    Acc.Mouse, <span class="blue">ifk</span>, <span class="blue">wait</span> K, 
    <span class="blue">wait</span> M, and other). Mouse commands don't work in 
  any window if currently active window has higher IL.</li>
  <li>Windows API functions that send messages (<span class="dll">SendMessage</span>, 
    <span class="dll">PostMessage</span>, etc). Only few messages can be sent.</li>
  <li>Many Windows API functions that manipulate windows (<span class="dll">SetWindowPos</span>, 
    <span class="dll">EnableWindow</span>, etc).</li>
  <li>Functions that use <span class="dll">SendMessage</span>, <span class="dll">SetWindowPos</span>, 
    etc . Most of them are menu and control functions (<span class="blue">men</span>, 
    <span class="blue">but</span>, <span class="UDF">CB_x</span>, <span class="UDF">LB_x</span>, 
    Acc.DoDefaultAction, etc) and window functions (<span class="blue">hid</span>, 
    <span class="blue">max</span>, <span class="blue">mov</span>, <span class="blue">siz</span>, <span class="UDF">ArrangeWindows</span>, <span class="UDF">Zorder</span>, 
    <span class="UDF">Transparent</span>, etc).</li>
  <li>Most hooks. For example, function <span class="UDF">BlockInput2</span> (available 
    in the forum) uses low level keyboard and mouse hooks.</li>
  <li><span class="dll">BlockInput</span> does not work with all windows.</li>
  <li>Toolbars cannot be attached to higher IL windows.</li>
  <li>Windows 8 and later: sending system hotkeys (Alt+Tab, Win+R etc) with <span class="blue">key</span>. This does not depend on the currently active window.</li>
  <li>And maybe more.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should not be a big problem, because normally most programs don't run 
  as administrator. Administrative programs usually are used briefly and don't 
  need to be automated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible workarounds (QM): 1. In Properties, check &quot;Run in separate process&quot; 
  and select Administrator. 2. Run QM as administrator or uiAccess. 3. Turn off UAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible workarounds (exe): 1. Run exe from QM: in Properties check &quot;Run 
  in separate process&quot; and select As QM (if QM runs as administrator or uiAccess) 
  or Administrator. If you need to launch it from e.g. desktop, create shortcut 
  to run the macro (in Properties). Of course, QM must be installed. 2. Set uiAccess=&quot;true&quot; 
  in the manifest, sign the exe file, and put it in Program Files folder. It works well on any computer (QM is 
  not needed). Read more about signing in the <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_MAKEEXE.html">make 
  exe</a> topic. 3. Run exe as administrator. It requires consent, unless exe 
  is started from another program that is running as administrator. 4. If possible, 
  don't run target programs as administrator. 5. Turn off UAC.</p>
<h2>64-bit Windows</h2>
<p> QM is a 32-bit program, but it runs well on 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If QM is running on 64-bit Windows, <a href="../Language/IDP_SPECVAR.html">special variable</a> _win64 is 1, else 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> On 64-bit Windows, there are separate System and Program Files 
  folders for 64-bit and 32-bit programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Special folder &quot;$program files$&quot; expands to the 32-bit 
  folder (&quot;Program Files (x86)&quot;). QM  is installed there. Environment variable &quot;%ProgramW6432%&quot; expands to the 64-bit 
  folder (&quot;Program Files&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Special folder &quot;$system$&quot;  expands to the 64-bit folder path (&quot;C:\Windows\System32&quot;), but 
  actually is used the 32-bit folder (&quot;C:\Windows\SysWOW64&quot;). That is, <a href="../Commands/IDP_RUN.html" class="blue">run</a> will launch 32-bit 
  versions of programs, unless flag 0x4000 used. See also <a href="http://www.quickmacros.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5028" target="_blank">this forum post</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Also, there are some separate registry locations for 32-bit 
  programs.</p>
