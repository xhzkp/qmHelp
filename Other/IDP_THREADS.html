<h1>
Threads</h1>

<p>A thread is a running macro or function. All functions it calls run 
  in the same thread.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates 
  CPU time. It executes code. Each thread runs simultaneously with other threads. Every process (running program) has one or more threads. To create effect 
  of several simultaneously running threads, operating system divides CPU time 
  into time slices (~20 ms). It allocates a CPU time slice to each 
  thread that need it. The currently executing thread is suspended when its time 
  slice elapses, allowing another thread to run. If there are multiple CPU, threads 
  may run simultaneously on different CPU. You can read more in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing%29" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>QM creates new thread for each macro or function started by the user, a trigger, <a href="../Commands/IDP_MAC.html" class="blue">mac</a> or <a href="../Commands/IDP_TIM.html" class="blue">tim</a>. It also 
  creates new thread for  menu/toolbar/autotext items. Multiple threads can run simultaneously, except macros without option 'Run simultaneously'. Multiple threads of the same function etc also can run simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All currently running threads, except special threads, are displayed in the 
  Running Items list. To see the list, check View Active Items in the Run menu. 
  Private threads are hidden by default. To see threads without opening QM window, use QM tray menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Special threads</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two threads that run all the time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. QM main thread. Functions that run in it: global variable constructors/destructors, 
  toolbar hook functions, functions executed during compilation and some other 
  functions. Also, a macro or other application can send <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_TRIG_COMMANDLINE.html">message</a> 
  to run a function in the main thread.</p>
<p>2. Thread of <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_TFF.html">filter functions</a>. All filter functions of key, mouse and window triggers run in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../Language/IDP_SCOPE.html">Thread variables</a> of these threads are destroyed when unloading <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_QML.html">QM file</a>, before destroying global variables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Threads also can be explicitly or implicitly created by some dll functions, for example <span class="dll">CreateThread</span>. Avoid such functions if possible, because then QM cannot destroy thread variables and free some other memory allocated for that thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all these special threads don't use <a href="../Flow/IDP_ATEND.html" class="blue">atend</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before a thread ends:</p>
<ol>
  <li>QM 2.3.4. All top-level windows of that thread receive <span class="def">WM_QM_ENDTHREAD</span> message. They should destroy self (<span class="dll">DestroyWindow</span>) and free their allocated data to avoid memory leaks.</li>
  <li>Called functions registered with <a href="../Flow/IDP_ATEND.html" class="blue">atend</a>.</li>
  <li>Destroyed local variables of thread main function.</li>
  <li>Destroyed thread variables.</li>
</ol>
