<h1> Unicode, UTF-8</h1>

<p>Unicode is used to display text in any language, 
  including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Russian. It is a character set 
  consisting of more than 100000 characters. ANSI character sets have only <a href="../Tables/IDP_ASCII.html">256 
  different characters</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QM supports Unicode, starting from version 2.3.0. 
  You can use any characters in macros, triggers, window names, file names, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> QM can run in ANSI mode (like in previous versions) 
  or Unicode mode. To enable Unicode mode, check the checkbox in Options. If the 
  checkbox in Options is unchecked, QM runs in ANSI mode, like in previous versions. 
  To enable Unicode for a <a href="../User/IDH_DIALOG_EDITOR.html#L18">dialog</a>, 
  also check the checkbox in dialog editor Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> QM does not use wide character strings (UTF-16). 
  Instead, when running in Unicode mode, it uses UTF-8. It is a Unicode encoding. 
  Characters in range 0 to 127 (<a href="../Tables/IDP_ASCII.html">ASCII</a> characters) 
  are the same in both modes. They consist of 1 byte. Other characters consist 
  of 2-4 bytes. In ANSI mode, all characters consist of 1 byte.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is recommended to use Unicode mode. Especially 
  if your system character set is multibyte, for example chinese simplified, because 
  then in ANSI mode some characters also consist of more than 1 byte, and QM does not work well with it. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> If you enable Unicode mode, you also have to retype 
  all non ASCII characters in macros, triggers and everywhere in QM interface. 
  Or run the converter, read below. It is because in Unicode mode text is interpreted 
  as UTF-8, and these characters must be encoded using UTF-8. Since the text was 
  entered in ANSI mode, these characters in Unicode mode are invalid. Invalid 
  characters are displayed as hexadecimal character codes in black rectangles. 
  You also will have to retype non ASCII character <a href="../Language/IDP_CONSTANT.html">escape 
  sequences</a> in strings. If something containing non ASCII characters is encrypted 
  - you'll have to re-encrypt it. If you switch back to ANSI mode, non ASCII characters 
  entered in Unicode mode also will become invalid because they are encoded as 
  several bytes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> QM does not do any conversions of data when you change Unicode 
  mode. However, there is an ANSI to Unicode converter. After switching to Unicode 
  mode, in Options click the small arrow button beside the Unicode checkbox. It displays all items containing 
  non-ASCII characters. These items must be converted to Unicode, unless you already 
  did it. Click an item name in the output to open the item. Click again to convert. 
  Note that QM cannot know whether the item is already converted. If QM thinks 
  it might be already converted, QM displays a warning message box. Note that 
  QM may fail to convert macros created on other computers because of different 
  ANSI character set (Control Panel -&gt; Regional -&gt; Advanced or Administrative 
  -&gt; Language for non-Unicode programs). An Unicode to ANSI converter is not 
  available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After switching Unicode mode, you also may have to 
  change something else in macros created in other mode. It is documented in help 
  topics of the functions that behave differently in ANSI and Unicode modes. Search 
  for &quot;UTF-8&quot; or &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you did not use non ASCII characters, after switching 
  to/from Unicode mode everything should work well without any modifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all QM functions and other features support Unicode. Where it is not supported, 
  or partially supported, or needs to review/edit code, it is documented in the 
  Help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All string functions where you can specify string length (or 
  character offset, number of characters, etc), always interpret it as number 
  of bytes. In Unicode mode, it is not always equal to the number of characters 
  because non ASCII characters consist of several bytes. Some functions may have 
  an option to specify number of UTF-8 characters instead of bytes. Be careful 
  when working with strings that contain non ASCII characters. For example, if 
  you split a string in a middle of a character that consists of several bytes, 
  the string will be invalid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use <a onClick="doSection(e1)" class="expand">this macro</a> to see 
  what characters require more than 1 byte.</p>
<div id="e1" class="expand">

  <p>Unicode characters with character codes &gt;0xFFFF are rarely used. They 
    require 4 bytes when encoded in UTF-8. In UTF-16 they require 2 words (4 bytes). 
    Other characters (0 to 0xFFFF) in UTF-8 require 1 to 3 bytes.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working in Unicode mode, sometimes you have ANSI text that you get 
  from an external source, for example from a file. If the text contains non ASCII 
  characters, you may have to convert 
  it to UTF-8 to make compatible with QM functions. And vice versa. Use <span class="type">str</span> function <span class="UDF">ConvertEncoding</span> or <a href="../str/IDP_S_UNICODE.html" class="blue">unicode/ansi</a> or <span class="UDF">LoadUnicodeFile</span>. Explicit conversions are rarely needed, because QM functions 
  that know external text format convert the text automatically. For example 
    window/control/object names, file 
  names, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To store Unicode text, often is used UTF-16 format, where all characters consist 
  of 2 bytes (rarely 4). For example, variables of BSTR type use UTF-16. 
  In some cases working with such text is easier than with UTF-8, because of fixed length 
  characters. However it is difficult to use in some programs (including QM), 
  and in most cases requires more space. To store text of various languages without 
  using UTF-16, are used various character sets and encodings. The UTF-8 encodes 
  Unicode characters in a string so that the string in most cases looks like ANSI 
  for programs that don't use UTF-16, but UTF-8-aware programs (including QM, 
  when it runs in Unicode mode) can display all Unicode characters in the string.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of characters, their values and size in ANSI, UTF-16 and UTF-8:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table class="tnormal"><col>
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>ANSI</td>
    <td>UTF-16</td>
    <td><p>Number of bytes used in UTF-8</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>A</td>
    <td>65</td>
    <td>65 (2 bytes: 65 0)</td>
    <td>1, like all characters in range 0 to 127</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&copy;</td>
    <td>169</td>
    <td>169 (2 bytes: 169 0)</td>
    <td>2, like all characters in range 128 to 255</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#x03B2;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>0x03B2 (2 bytes)</td>
    <td>2, like all characters in range 0x100 (256) to 0x7FF</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#x5CB8;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>0x5CB8 (2 bytes)</td>
    <td>3, like all characters in range 0x800 to 0xFFFF</td>
  </tr>
