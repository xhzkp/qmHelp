<h1>Callout callback function</h1>

<p> <a href="IDH_PCRE.html">PCRE</a> provides a feature called &quot;callout&quot;, which is a means of temporarily passing control to the caller of PCRE in the middle of pattern matching. Within a regular expression, (?C) indicates the points at which the external function is to be called. Different callout points can be identified by putting a number less than 256 after the letter C. The default value is zero. For example, this pattern has two callout points:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>(?C1)\dabc(?C2)def</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Types FINDRX (used with <a href="../Functions/IDP_FINDRX.html" class="blue">findrx</a>) and REPLACERX (used with <a href="../str/IDP_S_REPLACERX.html"> str.replacerx</a>) have member <b>fcallout</b>. If <b>fcallout</b> is address of user-defined function, that function is called each time a callout is encountered in pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A template is available in menu -&gt; File -&gt; New -&gt; Templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The function must begin with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=c> /
</span><span class=fq>function</span>[c]<span class=o>#</span> <span class=t>CALLOUT</span><span class=o>&#38;</span>x</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is variable of type CALLOUT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre class=cod><span class=fq>type</span> <span class=t>CALLOUT</span> version number <span class=t>CHARRANGE</span><span class=o>*</span>vec <span class=o>$</span>subject length start_match current_position capture_top capture_last <span class=t>FINDRX</span><span class=o>*</span>frx []<span class=t>REPLACERX</span><span class=o>*</span>rrx</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="parts">
<p><b>version</b> - version number of the type.</p>

<p>
<b>number</b> - number of the callout, as compiled into the pattern (that is, the number 
after ?C).</p>

<p>
<b>vec</b> - array of offsets in subject string. The content can be inspected in 
order to extract substrings that have been matched so far. </p>

<p>
<b>subject</b> - subject string (
<b>s</b> in str.replacerx, 
<b>string</b> 
in 
<span class="blue">findrx</span>).</p>

<p>
<b>length</b> - length of subject string.</p>

<p>
<b>start_match</b> - offset within the subject at which the current match attempt started. 
If the pattern is not anchored, the callout function may be called several 
times for different starting points.</p>

<p>
<b>current_position</b> - offset within the subject of the current match pointer.</p>

<p>
<b>capture_top</b> - one more than the number of the highest numbered captured substring 
so far (that is, 
<b>vec</b> length). 
If no substrings have been captured, the value of 
<b>capture_top </b>is one.</p>

<p>
<b>capture_last</b> - number of the most recently captured substring.</p>

<p>
<b>rf</b> - address of variable that was passed to 
<span class="blue">findrx</span>.</p>

<p>
<b>rr</b> - address of variable that was passed to str.replacerx.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Return values </h4>

<table class="tflags">

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>matching proceeds as normal.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>&gt; 0</td>
<td>matching fails at the current point, but backtracking to test other 
 possibilities goes ahead, just as if a lookahead assertion had failed.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>matching fails (not found).</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>&lt; -1</td>
<td>generate error with this error number. Should be &lt; -100.</td></tr>
