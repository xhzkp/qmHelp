<h1>Regular expressions</h1>
<p><a href="IDH_PCRE.html">Reference</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regular expressions are used to find, find-replace and split strings. QM has 
  two functions that use regular expressions: <a href="../Functions/IDP_FINDRX.html" class="blue">findrx</a> 
  and <a href="../str/IDP_S_REPLACERX.html">str.replacerx</a>. Regular expressions 
  also can be used with commands and functions that use <a href="../Other/IDP_WINDOWEXPRESSION.html">window 
  name</a>, with <a href="../QM_Help/IDH_TRIG_WINDOW.html">window triggers</a>, 
  and in the Find dialog. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A regular expression is a pattern of text that consists of ordinary characters 
  (for example, letters a through z) and special characters, known as <i>metacharacters</i>. 
  The pattern describes one or more strings to match when searching text. It is 
  like a string containing wildcard characters * and ? that you use when searching 
  for files, but regular expressions are much more powerful. The following table 
  contains some metacharacters and their behavior in the context of regular expressions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="tnormal">
  <tr> 
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>\ </td>
    <td>Marks the next character as either a special character, a 
      literal (removes special meaning from next metacharacter), a backreference, 
      anchor, or an octal|hex escape. For example, 't' matches the character &quot;t&quot;. 
      '\t' matches a tab character. The sequence '\\' matches &quot;\&quot;, and 
      &quot;\(&quot; matches &quot;(&quot;. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>. </td>
    <td><p>Matches any single character except new line character (\n). 
      If you use '(?s)' somewhere before, then . matches all characters.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Note: 
        A Windows new line consists of two characters - carriage return followed 
        by new line (\r\n). Since . matches carriage return (\r), sometimes you 
      may get unexpected results. Then use [^\r\n] instead of . .</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>[xyz] </td>
    <td><p>A character set. Matches any one of the enclosed characters. 
        For example, '[abc]' matches the 'a' in &quot;plain&quot;.</p>
      <p><br>
        Note: [digits] in strings is a QM <a href="../Language/IDP_CONSTANT.html">escape 
          sequence</a> and is replaced to a character code. 
        If you need literal [digits] in regular expression, use [91] instead of [. For 
        example, for [135] use [91]135]. Escape sequences are processed 
        before processing regular expression.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>[^xyz] </td>
    <td>A negative character set. Matches any character not enclosed. 
      For example, '[^abc]' matches the 'p' in &quot;plain&quot;. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>[a-z] </td>
    <td>A range of characters. Matches any character in the specified 
      range. For example, '[a-z]' matches any lowercase alphabetic character in 
      the range 'a' through 'z'. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>[^a-z] </td>
    <td>A negative range characters. Matches any character not in 
      the specified range. For example, '[^a-z]' matches any character not in 
      the range 'a' through 'z'. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>* </td>
    <td>Matches the preceding subexpression zero or more times. For 
      example, zo* matches &quot;z&quot; and &quot;zoo&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>+ </td>
    <td>Matches the preceding subexpression one or more times. For 
      example, 'zo+' matches &quot;zo&quot; and &quot;zoo&quot;, but not &quot;z&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>? </td>
    <td>Matches the preceding subexpression zero or one time. For 
      example, &quot;do(es)?&quot; matches the &quot;do&quot; in &quot;do&quot; 
      or &quot;does&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>{n} </td>
    <td>Matches exactly <span class=c6>n</span> times (<span class=c6>n</span> 
      is a nonnegative integer). For example, 'o{2}' does not match the 'o' in 
      &quot;Bob,&quot; but matches the two o's in &quot;food&quot;. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>{n,} </td>
    <td>Matches at least <span class=c6>n</span> times. For example, 
      'o{2,}' does not match the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;Bob&quot; and matches 
      all the o's in &quot;foooood&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>{n,m} </td>
    <td>Matches at least <span class=c6>n</span> and at most <span class=c6>m</span> 
      times. For example, &quot;o{1,3}&quot; matches the first three o's in &quot;fooooood&quot;. 
      Note that you cannot put a space between the comma and the numbers. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>? </td>
    <td>When this character immediately follows any of the other quantifiers 
      (*, +, ?, { <span class=c6>n</span>}, { <span class=c6>n</span>,}, { <span class=c6>n</span>, 
      <span class=c6>m</span>}), the matching pattern is non-greedy. A non-greedy 
      pattern matches as little of the searched string as possible, whereas the 
      default greedy pattern matches as much of the searched string as possible. 
      For example, in the string &quot;oooo&quot;, 'o+?' matches a single &quot;o&quot;, 
      while 'o+' matches all 'o's. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>^ </td>
    <td>Matches the position at the beginning of the input string. 
      If multiline flag is set, ^ also matches the position at beginning of line. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>$ </td>
    <td>Matches the position at the end of the input string. If multiline 
      flag is set, $ also matches the position at end of line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>\b </td>
    <td>Matches a word boundary, that is, the position between a word 
      and a space (or other delimiter, e.g. comma). For example, 'er\b' matches 
      the 'er' in &quot;never&quot; but not the 'er' in &quot;verb&quot;. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>\B </td>
    <td>Matches a nonword boundary. 'er\B' matches the 'er' in &quot;verb&quot;

      '\(' or '\)'. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>(?:pattern) </td>
    <td>Matches <span class=c6>pattern</span> but does not capture 
      the match, that is, it is a non-capturing match that is not stored for possible 
      later use. This is useful for combining parts of a pattern with the &quot;or&quot; 
      character (|). For example, 'industr(?:y|ies) is a more economical expression 
      than 'industry|industries'. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Positive lookahead matches the search string at any point 
      where a string matching <span class=c6>pattern</span> begins. This is a 
      non-capturing match, that is, the match is not captured for possible later 
      use. For example 'Windows (?=95|98|NT|2000)' matches &quot;Windows&quot; 
      in &quot;Windows 2000&quot; but not &quot;Windows&quot; in &quot;Windows 
      3.1&quot;. Lookaheads do not consume characters, that is, after a match 
      occurs, the search for the next match begins immediately following the last 
      match, not after the characters that comprised the lookahead. </td>

      use. For example 'Windows (?!95|98|NT|2000)' matches &quot;Windows&quot; 
      in &quot;Windows 3.1&quot; but does not match &quot;Windows&quot; in &quot;Windows 
      2000&quot;. Lookaheads do not consume characters, that is, after a match

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>x|y </td>
    <td>Matches either <span class=c6>x</span> or <span class=c6>y</span>.

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>\cx </td>

      For example, \cM matches a Control-M or carriage return character. The value 
      of <span class=c6>x</span> must be in the range of A-Z or a-z. If not, c 
      is assumed to be a literal 'c' character. </td>

<h2>PCRE</h2>

<p>Regular expression support is provided by the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" target="_blank">PCRE 
  library</a>, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, 
  and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern 
  matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl, with just a few differences. 
  QM uses PCRE version 4.4. It corresponds approximately with Perl 5.8.</p>
<h2><a name="utf8"></a>UTF-8</h2>
<p>When QM is running in Unicode mode, it stores text in UTF-8 format. When text 
  is in UTF-8 format, non <a href="../Tables/IDP_ASCII.html">ASCII</a> characters 
  consist of 2-4 bytes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> QM does not support UTF-8 mode (option RX_UTF8) in regular expressions. Non 
  ASCII characters can be used, but they are interpreted as 2-4 separate bytes, 
  not as single character. For example, <tt>.</tt> matches 
  single byte, not whole character. Also, with non ASCII characters are not recognized 
  word boundaries (\b), character classes (\w, \s, etc), not supported case insensitivity, 
  etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In most cases all this will not be a problem. However in some cases, when 
  there are non ASCII characters in regular expression or subject string, you 
  have to build the regular expression differently, and maybe use <a href="../Functions/IDP_FINDRX.html">flag 
  32</a>.</p>
